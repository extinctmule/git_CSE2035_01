i cedric himself knew nothing whatever about it
it had never been even mentioned to him
he knew that his papa had been an englishman because his mamma had told him so but then his papa had died when he was so little a boy that he could not remember very much about him except that he was big and had blue eyes and a long mustache and that it was a splendid thing to be carried around the room on his shoulder
since his papa death cedric had found out that it was best not to talk to his mamma about him
when his father was ill cedric had been sent away and when he had returned everything was over and his mother who had been very ill too was only just beginning to sit in her chair by the window
she was pale and thin and all the dimples had gone from her pretty face and her eyes looked large and mournful and she was dressed in black
dearest said cedric his papa had called her that always and so the little boy had learned to say it  dearest is my papa better
he felt her arms tremble and so he turned his curly head and looked in her face
there was something in it that made him feel that he was going to cry
dearest he said is he well
then suddenly his loving little heart told him that hed better put both his arms around her neck and kiss her again and again and keep his soft cheek close to hers and he did so and she laid her face on his shoulder and cried bitterly holding him as if she could never let him go again
yes he is well she sobbed he is quite quite well but we  we have no one left but each other
no one at all
then little as he was he understood that his big handsome young papa would not come back any more that he was dead as he had heard of other people being although he could not comprehend exactly what strange thing had brought all this sadness about
it was because his mamma always cried when he spoke of his papa that he secretly made up his mind it was better not to speak of him very often to her and he found out too that it was better not to let her sit still and look into the fire or out of the window without moving or talking
he and his mamma knew very few people and lived what might have been thought very lonely lives although cedric did not know it was lonely until he grew older and heard why it was they had no visitors
then he was told that his mamma was an orphan and quite alone in the world when his papa had married her
she was very pretty and had been living as companion to a rich old lady who was not kind to her and one day captain cedric errol who was calling at the house saw her run up the stairs with tears on her eyelashes and she looked so sweet and innocent and sorrowful that the captain could not forget her
and after many strange things had happened they knew each other well and loved each other dearly and were married although their marriage brought them the ill will of several persons
the one who was most angry of all however was the captain father who lived in england and was a very rich and important old nobleman with a very bad temper and a very violent dislike to america and americans
he had two sons older than captain cedric and it was the law that the elder of these sons should inherit the family title and estates which were very rich and splendid if the eldest son died the next one would be heir so though he was a member of such a great family there was little chance that captain cedric would be very rich himself
but it so happened that nature had given to the youngest son gifts which she had not bestowed upon his elder brothers
he had a beautiful face and a fine strong graceful figure he had a bright smile and a sweet gay voice he was brave and generous and had the kindest heart in the world and seemed to have the power to make every one love him
and it was not so with his elder brothers neither of them was handsome or very kind or clever
when they were boys at eton they were not popular when they were at college they cared nothing for study and wasted both time and money and made few real friends
the old earl their father was constantly disappointed and humiliated by them his heir was no honor to his noble name and did not promise to end in being anything but a selfish wasteful insignificant man with no manly or noble qualities
it was very bitter the old earl thought that the son who was only third and would have only a very small fortune should be the one who had all the gifts and all the charms and all the strength and beauty
sometimes he almost hated the handsome young man because he seemed to have the good things which should have gone with the stately title and the magnificent estates and yet in the depths of his proud stubborn old heart he could not help caring very much for his youngest son
it was in one of his fits of petulance that he sent him off to travel in america he thought he would send him away for a while so that he should not be made angry by constantly contrasting him with his brothers who were at that time giving him a great deal of trouble by their wild ways
but after about six months he began to feel lonely and longed in secret to see his son again so he wrote to captain cedric and ordered him home
the letter he wrote crossed on its way a letter the captain had just written to his father telling of his love for the pretty american girl and of his intended marriage and when the earl received that letter he was furiously angry
bad as his temper was he had never given way to it in his life as he gave way to it when he read the captain letter
his valet who was in the room when it came thought his lordship would have a fit of apoplexy he was so wild with anger
for an hour he raged like a tiger and then he sat down and wrote to his son and ordered him never to come near his old home nor to write to his father or brothers again
he told him he might live as he pleased and die where he pleased that he should be cut off from his family forever and that he need never expect help from his father as long as he lived
the captain was very sad when he read the letter he was very fond of england and he dearly loved the beautiful home where he had been born he had even loved his ill tempered old father and had sympathized with him in his disappointments but he knew he need expect no kindness from him in the future
at first he scarcely knew what to do he had not been brought up to work and had no business experience but he had courage and plenty of determination
so he sold his commission in the english army and after some trouble found a situation in new york and married
the change from his old life in england was very great but he was young and happy and he hoped that hard work would do great things for him in the future
he had a small house on a quiet street and his little boy was born there and everything was so gay and cheerful in a simple way that he was never sorry for a moment that he had married the rich old lady pretty companion just because she was so sweet and he loved her and she loved him
she was very sweet indeed and her little boy was like both her and his father
though he was born in so quiet and cheap a little home it seemed as if there never had been a more fortunate baby
in the first place he was always well and so he never gave any one trouble in the second place he had so sweet a temper and ways so charming that he was a pleasure to every one and in the third place he was so beautiful to look at that he was quite a picture
instead of being a bald headed baby he started in life with a quantity of soft fine gold colored hair which curled up at the ends and went into loose rings by the time he was six months old he had big brown eyes and long eyelashes and a darling little face he had so strong a back and such splendid sturdy legs that at nine months he learned suddenly to walk his manners were so good for a baby that it was delightful to make his acquaintance
he seemed to feel that every one was his friend and when any one spoke to him when he was in his carriage in the street he would give the stranger one sweet serious look with the brown eyes and then follow it with a lovely friendly smile and the consequence was that there was not a person in the neighborhood of the quiet street where he lived  even to the groceryman at the corner who was considered the crossest creature alive  who was not pleased to see him and speak to him
and every month of his life he grew handsomer and more interesting
when he was old enough to walk out with his nurse dragging a small wagon and wearing a short white kilt skirt and a big white hat set back on his curly yellow hair he was so handsome and strong and rosy that he attracted every one attention and his nurse would come home and tell his mamma stories of the ladies who had stopped their carriages to look at and speak to him and of how pleased they were when he talked to them in his cheerful little way as if he had known them always
his greatest charm was this cheerful fearless quaint little way of making friends with people
i think it arose from his having a very confiding nature and a kind little heart that sympathized with every one and wished to make every one as comfortable as he liked to be himself
it made him very quick to understand the feelings of those about him
perhaps this had grown on him too because he had lived so much with his father and mother who were always loving and considerate and tender and well bred
he had never heard an unkind or uncourteous word spoken at home he had always been loved and caressed and treated tenderly and so his childish soul was full of kindness and innocent warm feeling
he had always heard his mamma called by pretty loving names and so he used them himself when he spoke to her he had always seen that his papa watched over her and took great care of her and so he learned too to be careful of her
so when he knew his papa would come back no more and saw how very sad his mamma was there gradually came into his kind little heart the thought that he must do what he could to make her happy
he was not much more than a baby but that thought was in his mind whenever he climbed upon her knee and kissed her and put his curly head on her neck and when he brought his toys and picture books to show her and when he curled up quietly by her side as she used to lie on the sofa
he was not old enough to know of anything else to do so he did what he could and was more of a comfort to her than he could have understood
oh mary
he heard her say once to her old servant i am sure he is trying to help me in his innocent way  i know he is
he looks at me sometimes with a loving wondering little look as if he were sorry for me and then he will come and pet me or show me something
he is such a little man i really think he knows
as he grew older he had a great many quaint little ways which amused and interested people greatly
he was so much of a companion for his mother that she scarcely cared for any other
they used to walk together and talk together and play together
when he was quite a little fellow he learned to read and after that he used to lie on the hearth rug in the evening and read aloud  sometimes stories and sometimes big books such as older people read and sometimes even the newspaper and often at such times mary in the kitchen would hear mrs errol laughing with delight at the quaint things he said
and indade said mary to the groceryman nobody cud help laughin at the quare little ways of him  and his ould fashioned sayin
didnt he come into my kitchen the noight the new prisident was nominated and shtand afore the fire lookin loike a pictur wid his hands in his shmall pockets an his innocent bit of a face as sayrious as a jedge
an sez he to me mary sez he im very much intrusted in the lection sez he
im a publican an so is dearest
are you a publican mary
orra a bit sez i im the bist o dimmycrats
an he looks up at me wid a look that ud go to yer heart an sez he mary sez he the country will go to ruin
an nivver a day since thin has he let go by widout argyin wid me to change me polytics
mary was very fond of him and very proud of him too
she had been with his mother ever since he was born and after his father death had been cook and housemaid and nurse and everything else
she was proud of his graceful strong little body and his pretty manners and especially proud of the bright curly hair which waved over his forehead and fell in charming love locks on his shoulders
she was willing to work early and late to help his mamma make his small suits and keep them in order
ristycratic is it
she would say
faith an id loike to see the choild on fifth avey noo as looks loike him an shteps out as handsome as himself
an ivvery man woman and choild lookin afther him in his bit of a black velvet skirt made out of the misthress ould gownd an his little head up an his curly hair flyin an shinin
it loike a young lord he looks
cedric did not know that he looked like a young lord he did not know what a lord was
his greatest friend was the groceryman at the corner  the cross groceryman who was never cross to him
his name was mr hobbs and cedric admired and respected him very much
he thought him a very rich and powerful person he had so many things in his store  prunes and figs and oranges and biscuits  and he had a horse and wagon
cedric was fond of the milkman and the baker and the apple woman but he liked mr hobbs best of all and was on terms of such intimacy with him that he went to see him every day and often sat with him quite a long time discussing the topics of the hour
it was quite surprising how many things they found to talk about  the fourth of july for instance
when they began to talk about the fourth of july there really seemed no end to it
mr hobbs had a very bad opinion of the british and he told the whole story of the revolution relating very wonderful and patriotic stories about the villainy of the enemy and the bravery of the revolutionary heroes and he even generously repeated part of the declaration of independence
cedric was so excited that his eyes shone and his cheeks were red and his curls were all rubbed and tumbled into a yellow mop
he could hardly wait to eat his dinner after he went home he was so anxious to tell his mamma
it was perhaps mr hobbs who gave him his first interest in politics
mr hobbs was fond of reading the newspapers and so cedric heard a great deal about what was going on in washington and mr hobbs would tell him whether the president was doing his duty or not
and once when there was an election he found it all quite grand and probably but for mr hobbs and cedric the country might have been wrecked
mr hobbs took him to see a great torchlight procession and many of the men who carried torches remembered afterward a stout man who stood near a lamp post and held on his shoulder a handsome little shouting boy who waved his cap in the air
it was not long after this election when cedric was between seven and eight years old that the very strange thing happened which made so wonderful a change in his life
it was quite curious too that the day it happened he had been talking to mr hobbs about england and the queen and mr hobbs had said some very severe things about the aristocracy being specially indignant against earls and marquises
it had been a hot morning and after playing soldiers with some friends of his cedric had gone into the store to rest and had found mr hobbs looking very fierce over a piece of the illustrated london news which contained a picture of some court ceremony
ah he said that the way they go on now but theyll get enough of it some day when those theyve trod on rise and blow em up sky high  earls and marquises and all
it coming and they may look out for it
cedric had perched himself as usual on the high stool and pushed his hat back and put his hands in his pockets in delicate compliment to mr hobbs
did you ever know many marquises mr hobbs
cedric inquired  or earls
no answered mr hobbs with indignation i guess not
id like to catch one of em inside here that all
ill have no grasping tyrants sittin round on my cracker barrels
and he was so proud of the sentiment that he looked around proudly and mopped his forehead
perhaps they wouldnt be earls if they knew any better said cedric feeling some vague sympathy for their unhappy condition
wouldnt they
said mr hobbs
they just glory in it
it in em
theyre a bad lot
they were in the midst of their conversation when mary appeared
cedric thought she had come to buy some sugar perhaps but she had not
she looked almost pale and as if she were excited about something
come home darlint she said the misthress is wantin yez
cedric slipped down from his stool
does she want me to go out with her mary
he asked
good morning mr hobbs
ill see you again
he was surprised to see mary staring at him in a dumfounded fashion and he wondered why she kept shaking her head
what the matter mary
he said
is it the hot weather
no said mary but there strange things happenin to us
has the sun given dearest a headache
he inquired anxiously
but it was not that
when he reached his own house there was a coupe standing before the door and some one was in the little parlor talking to his mamma
mary hurried him upstairs and put on his best summer suit of cream colored flannel with the red scarf around his waist and combed out his curly locks
lords is it
he heard her say
an the nobility an gintry
och
bad cess to them
lords indade  worse luck
it was really very puzzling but he felt sure his mamma would tell him what all the excitement meant so he allowed mary to bemoan herself without asking many questions
when he was dressed he ran downstairs and went into the parlor
a tall thin old gentleman with a sharp face was sitting in an arm chair
his mother was standing near by with a pale face and he saw that there were tears in her eyes
oh
ceddie
she cried out and ran to her little boy and caught him in her arms and kissed him in a frightened troubled way
oh
ceddie darling
the tall old gentleman rose from his chair and looked at cedric with his sharp eyes
he rubbed his thin chin with his bony hand as he looked
he seemed not at all displeased
and so he said at last slowly  and so this is little lord fauntleroy
ii there was never a more amazed little boy than cedric during the week that followed there was never so strange or so unreal a week
in the first place the story his mamma told him was a very curious one
he was obliged to hear it two or three times before he could understand it
he could not imagine what mr hobbs would think of it
it began with earls his grandpapa whom he had never seen was an earl and his eldest uncle if he had not been killed by a fall from his horse would have been an earl too in time and after his death his other uncle would have been an earl if he had not died suddenly in rome of a fever
after that his own papa if he had lived would have been an earl but since they all had died and only cedric was left it appeared that he was to be an earl after his grandpapa death  and for the present he was lord fauntleroy
he turned quite pale when he was first told of it
oh
dearest
he said i should rather not be an earl
none of the boys are earls
cant i not be one
but it seemed to be unavoidable
and when that evening they sat together by the open window looking out into the shabby street he and his mother had a long talk about it
cedric sat on his footstool clasping one knee in his favorite attitude and wearing a bewildered little face rather red from the exertion of thinking
his grandfather had sent for him to come to england and his mamma thought he must go
because she said looking out of the window with sorrowful eyes i know your papa would wish it to be so ceddie
he loved his home very much and there are many things to be thought of that a little boy cant quite understand
i should be a selfish little mother if i did not send you
when you are a man you will see why
ceddie shook his head mournfully
i shall be very sorry to leave mr hobbs he said
im afraid hell miss me and i shall miss him
and i shall miss them all
when mr havisham  who was the family lawyer of the earl of dorincourt and who had been sent by him to bring lord fauntleroy to england  came the next day cedric heard many things
but somehow it did not console him to hear that he was to be a very rich man when he grew up and that he would have castles here and castles there and great parks and deep mines and grand estates and tenantry
he was troubled about his friend mr hobbs and he went to see him at the store soon after breakfast in great anxiety of mind
he found him reading the morning paper and he approached him with a grave demeanor
he really felt it would be a great shock to mr hobbs to hear what had befallen him and on his way to the store he had been thinking how it would be best to break the news
hello
said mr hobbs
mornin
good morning said cedric
he did not climb up on the high stool as usual but sat down on a cracker box and clasped his knee and was so silent for a few moments that mr hobbs finally looked up inquiringly over the top of his newspaper
hello
he said again
cedric gathered all his strength of mind together
mr hobbs he said do you remember what we were talking about yesterday morning
well replied mr hobbs  seems to me it was england
yes said cedric but just when mary came for me you know
mr hobbs rubbed the back of his head
we was mentioning queen victoria and the aristocracy
yes said cedric rather hesitatingly and  and earls dont you know
why yes returned mr hobbs we did touch em up a little that so
cedric flushed up to the curly bang on his forehead
nothing so embarrassing as this had ever happened to him in his life
he was a little afraid that it might be a trifle embarrassing to mr hobbs too
you said he proceeded that you wouldnt have them sitting round on your cracker barrels
so i did
returned mr hobbs stoutly
and i meant it
let em try it  that all
mr hobbs said cedric one is sitting on this box now
mr hobbs almost jumped out of his chair
what
he exclaimed
yes cedric announced with due modesty i am one  or i am going to be
i wont deceive you
mr hobbs looked agitated
he rose up suddenly and went to look at the thermometer
the mercury got into your head
he exclaimed turning back to examine his young friend countenance
it is a hot day
how do you feel
got any pain
when did you begin to feel that way
he put his big hand on the little boy hair
this was more embarrassing than ever
thank you said ceddie im all right
there is nothing the matter with my head
im sorry to say it true mr hobbs
that was what mary came to take me home for
mr havisham was telling my mamma and he is a lawyer
mr hobbs sank into his chair and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief
one of us has got a sunstroke
he exclaimed
no returned cedric we havent
we shall have to make the best of it mr hobbs
mr havisham came all the way from england to tell us about it
my grandpapa sent him
mr hobbs stared wildly at the innocent serious little face before him
who is your grandfather
he asked
cedric put his hand in his pocket and carefully drew out a piece of paper on which something was written in his own round irregular hand
i couldnt easily remember it so i wrote it down on this he said
and he read aloud slowly john arthur molyneux errol earl of dorincourt
that is his name and he lives in a castle  in two or three castles i think
and my papa who died was his youngest son and i shouldnt have been a lord or an earl if my papa hadnt died and my papa wouldnt have been an earl if his two brothers hadnt died
but they all died and there is no one but me  no boy  and so i have to be one and my grandpapa has sent for me to come to england
mr hobbs seemed to grow hotter and hotter
he mopped his forehead and his bald spot and breathed hard
he began to see that something very remarkable had happened but when he looked at the little boy sitting on the cracker box with the innocent anxious expression in his childish eyes and saw that he was not changed at all but was simply as he had been the day before just a handsome cheerful brave little fellow in a blue suit and red neck ribbon all this information about the nobility bewildered him
he was all the more bewildered because cedric gave it with such ingenuous simplicity and plainly without realizing himself how stupendous it was
wha  what did you say your name was
mr hobbs inquired
it cedric errol lord fauntleroy answered cedric
that was what mr havisham called me
he said when i went into the room and so this is little lord fauntleroy
well said mr hobbs ill be  jiggered
this was an exclamation he always used when he was very much astonished or excited
he could think of nothing else to say just at that puzzling moment
cedric felt it to be quite a proper and suitable ejaculation
his respect and affection for mr hobbs were so great that he admired and approved of all his remarks
he had not seen enough of society as yet to make him realize that sometimes mr hobbs was not quite conventional
he knew of course that he was different from his mamma but then his mamma was a lady and he had an idea that ladies were always different from gentlemen
he looked at mr hobbs wistfully
england is a long way off isnt it
he asked
it across the atlantic ocean mr hobbs answered
that the worst of it said cedric
perhaps i shall not see you again for a long time
i dont like to think of that mr hobbs
the best of friends must part said mr hobbs
well said cedric we have been friends for a great many years havent we
ever since you was born mr hobbs answered
you was about six weeks old when you was first walked out on this street
ah remarked cedric with a sigh i never thought i should have to be an earl then
you think said mr hobbs there no getting out of it
im afraid not answered cedric
my mamma says that my papa would wish me to do it
but if i have to be an earl there one thing i can do i can try to be a good one
im not going to be a tyrant
and if there is ever to be another war with america i shall try to stop it
his conversation with mr hobbs was a long and serious one
once having got over the first shock mr hobbs was not so rancorous as might have been expected he endeavored to resign himself to the situation and before the interview was at an end he had asked a great many questions
as cedric could answer but few of them he endeavored to answer them himself and being fairly launched on the subject of earls and marquises and lordly estates explained many things in a way which would probably have astonished mr havisham could that gentleman have heard it
but then there were many things which astonished mr havisham
he had spent all his life in england and was not accustomed to american people and american habits
he had been connected professionally with the family of the earl of dorincourt for nearly forty years and he knew all about its grand estates and its great wealth and importance and in a cold business like way he felt an interest in this little boy who in the future was to be the master and owner of them all  the future earl of dorincourt
he had known all about the old earl disappointment in his elder sons and all about his fierce rage at captain cedric american marriage and he knew how he still hated the gentle little widow and would not speak of her except with bitter and cruel words
he insisted that she was only a common american girl who had entrapped his son into marrying her because she knew he was an earl son
the old lawyer himself had more than half believed this was all true
he had seen a great many selfish mercenary people in his life and he had not a good opinion of americans
when he had been driven into the cheap street and his coupe had stopped before the cheap small house he had felt actually shocked
it seemed really quite dreadful to think that the future owner of dorincourt castle and wyndham towers and chorlworth and all the other stately splendors should have been born and brought up in an insignificant house in a street with a sort of green grocery at the corner
he wondered what kind of a child he would be and what kind of a mother he had
he rather shrank from seeing them both
he had a sort of pride in the noble family whose legal affairs he had conducted so long and it would have annoyed him very much to have found himself obliged to manage a woman who would seem to him a vulgar money loving person with no respect for her dead husband country and the dignity of his name
it was a very old name and a very splendid one and mr havisham had a great respect for it himself though he was only a cold keen business like old lawyer
when mary handed him into the small parlor he looked around it critically
it was plainly furnished but it had a home like look there were no cheap common ornaments and no cheap gaudy pictures the few adornments on the walls were in good taste and about the room were many pretty things which a woman hand might have made
not at all bad so far he had said to himself but perhaps the captain taste predominated
but when mrs errol came into the room he began to think she herself might have had something to do with it
if he had not been quite a self contained and stiff old gentleman he would probably have started when he saw her
she looked in the simple black dress fitting closely to her slender figure more like a young girl than the mother of a boy of seven
she had a pretty sorrowful young face and a very tender innocent look in her large brown eyes  the sorrowful look that had never quite left her face since her husband had died
cedric was used to seeing it there the only times he had ever seen it fade out had been when he was playing with her or talking to her and had said some old fashioned thing or used some long word he had picked up out of the newspapers or in his conversations with mr hobbs
he was fond of using long words and he was always pleased when they made her laugh though he could not understand why they were laughable they were quite serious matters with him
the lawyer experience taught him to read people characters very shrewdly and as soon as he saw cedric mother he knew that the old earl had made a great mistake in thinking her a vulgar mercenary woman
mr havisham had never been married he had never even been in love but he divined that this pretty young creature with the sweet voice and sad eyes had married captain errol only because she loved him with all her affectionate heart and that she had never once thought it an advantage that he was an earl son
and he saw he should have no trouble with her and he began to feel that perhaps little lord fauntleroy might not be such a trial to his noble family after all
the captain had been a handsome fellow and the young mother was very pretty and perhaps the boy might be well enough to look at
when he first told mrs errol what he had come for she turned very pale
oh
she said will he have to be taken away from me
we love each other so much
he is such a happiness to me
he is all i have
i have tried to be a good mother to him
and her sweet young voice trembled and the tears rushed into her eyes
you do not know what he has been to me
she said
the lawyer cleared his throat
i am obliged to tell you he said that the earl of dorincourt is not  is not very friendly toward you
he is an old man and his prejudices are very strong
he has always especially disliked america and americans and was very much enraged by his son marriage
i am sorry to be the bearer of so unpleasant a communication but he is very fixed in his determination not to see you
his plan is that lord fauntleroy shall be educated under his own supervision that he shall live with him
the earl is attached to dorincourt castle and spends a great deal of time there
he is a victim to inflammatory gout and is not fond of london
lord fauntleroy will therefore be likely to live chiefly at dorincourt
the earl offers you as a home court lodge which is situated pleasantly and is not very far from the castle
he also offers you a suitable income
lord fauntleroy will be permitted to visit you the only stipulation is that you shall not visit him or enter the park gates
you see you will not be really separated from your son and i assure you madam the terms are not so harsh as  as they might have been
the advantage of such surroundings and education as lord fauntleroy will have i am sure you must see will be very great
he felt a little uneasy lest she should begin to cry or make a scene as he knew some women would have done
it embarrassed and annoyed him to see women cry
but she did not
she went to the window and stood with her face turned away for a few moments and he saw she was trying to steady herself
captain errol was very fond of dorincourt she said at last
he loved england and everything english
it was always a grief to him that he was parted from his home
he was proud of his home and of his name
he would wish  i know he would wish that his son should know the beautiful old places and be brought up in such a way as would be suitable to his future position
then she came back to the table and stood looking up at mr havisham very gently
my husband would wish it she said
it will be best for my little boy
i know  i am sure the earl would not be so unkind as to try to teach him not to love me and i know  even if he tried  that my little boy is too much like his father to be harmed
he has a warm faithful nature and a true heart
he would love me even if he did not see me and so long as we may see each other i ought not to suffer very much
she thinks very little of herself the lawyer thought
she does not make any terms for herself
madam he said aloud i respect your consideration for your son
he will thank you for it when he is a man
i assure you lord fauntleroy will be most carefully guarded and every effort will be used to insure his happiness
the earl of dorincourt will be as anxious for his comfort and well being as you yourself could be
i hope said the tender little mother in a rather broken voice that his grandfather will love ceddie
the little boy has a very affectionate nature and he has always been loved
mr havisham cleared his throat again
he could not quite imagine the gouty fiery tempered old earl loving any one very much but he knew it would be to his interest to be kind in his irritable way to the child who was to be his heir
he knew too that if ceddie were at all a credit to his name his grandfather would be proud of him
lord fauntleroy will be comfortable i am sure he replied
it was with a view to his happiness that the earl desired that you should be near enough to him to see him frequently
he did not think it would be discreet to repeat the exact words the earl had used which were in fact neither polite nor amiable
mr havisham preferred to express his noble patron offer in smoother and more courteous language
he had another slight shock when mrs errol asked mary to find her little boy and bring him to her and mary told her where he was
sure ill foind him aisy enough maam she said for it wid mr hobbs he is this minnit settin on his high shtool by the counther an talkin pollytics most loikely or enjyin hisself among the soap an candles an pertaties as sinsible an shwate as ye plase
mr hobbs has known him all his life mrs errol said to the lawyer
he is very kind to ceddie and there is a great friendship between them
remembering the glimpse he had caught of the store as he passed it and having a recollection of the barrels of potatoes and apples and the various odds and ends mr havisham felt his doubts arise again
in england gentlemen sons did not make friends of grocerymen and it seemed to him a rather singular proceeding
it would be very awkward if the child had bad manners and a disposition to like low company
one of the bitterest humiliations of the old earl life had been that his two elder sons had been fond of low company
could it be he thought that this boy shared their bad qualities instead of his father good qualities
he was thinking uneasily about this as he talked to mrs errol until the child came into the room
when the door opened he actually hesitated a moment before looking at cedric
it would perhaps have seemed very queer to a great many people who knew him if they could have known the curious sensations that passed through mr havisham when he looked down at the boy who ran into his mother arms
he experienced a revulsion of feeling which was quite exciting
he recognized in an instant that here was one of the finest and handsomest little fellows he had ever seen
his beauty was something unusual
he had a strong lithe graceful little body and a manly little face he held his childish head up and carried himself with a brave air he was so like his father that it was really startling he had his father golden hair and his mother brown eyes but there was nothing sorrowful or timid in them
they were innocently fearless eyes he looked as if he had never feared or doubted anything in his life
he is the best bred looking and handsomest little fellow i ever saw was what mr havisham thought
what he said aloud was simply and so this is little lord fauntleroy
and after this the more he saw of little lord fauntleroy the more of a surprise he found him
he knew very little about children though he had seen plenty of them in england  fine handsome rosy girls and boys who were strictly taken care of by their tutors and governesses and who were sometimes shy and sometimes a trifle boisterous but never very interesting to a ceremonious rigid old lawyer
perhaps his personal interest in little lord fauntleroy fortunes made him notice ceddie more than he had noticed other children but however that was he certainly found himself noticing him a great deal
cedric did not know he was being observed and he only behaved himself in his ordinary manner
he shook hands with mr havisham in his friendly way when they were introduced to each other and he answered all his questions with the unhesitating readiness with which he answered mr hobbs
he was neither shy nor bold and when mr havisham was talking to his mother the lawyer noticed that he listened to the conversation with as much interest as if he had been quite grown up
he seems to be a very mature little fellow mr havisham said to the mother
i think he is in some things she answered
he has always been very quick to learn and he has lived a great deal with grownup people
he has a funny little habit of using long words and expressions he has read in books or has heard others use but he is very fond of childish play
i think he is rather clever but he is a very boyish little boy sometimes
the next time mr havisham met him he saw that this last was quite true
as his coupe turned the corner he caught sight of a group of small boys who were evidently much excited
two of them were about to run a race and one of them was his young lordship and he was shouting and making as much noise as the noisiest of his companions
he stood side by side with another boy one little red leg advanced a step
one to make ready
yelled the starter
two to be steady
three  and away
mr havisham found himself leaning out of the window of his coupe with a curious feeling of interest
he really never remembered having seen anything quite like the way in which his lordship lordly little red legs flew up behind his knickerbockers and tore over the ground as he shot out in the race at the signal word
he shut his small hands and set his face against the wind his bright hair streamed out behind
hooray ced errol
all the boys shouted dancing and shrieking with excitement
hooray billy williams
hooray ceddie
hooray billy
hooray
ray
ray
i really believe he is going to win said mr havisham
the way in which the red legs flew and flashed up and down the shrieks of the boys the wild efforts of billy williams whose brown legs were not to be despised as they followed closely in the rear of the red legs made him feel some excitement
i really  i really cant help hoping he will win
he said with an apologetic sort of cough
at that moment the wildest yell of all went up from the dancing hopping boys
with one last frantic leap the future earl of dorincourt had reached the lamp post at the end of the block and touched it just two seconds before billy williams flung himself at it panting
three cheers for ceddie errol
yelled the little boys
hooray for ceddie errol
mr havisham drew his head in at the window of his coupe and leaned back with a dry smile
bravo lord fauntleroy
he said
as his carriage stopped before the door of mrs errol house the victor and the vanquished were coming toward it attended by the clamoring crew
cedric walked by billy williams and was speaking to him
his elated little face was very red his curls clung to his hot moist forehead his hands were in his pockets
you see he was saying evidently with the intention of making defeat easy for his unsuccessful rival i guess i won because my legs are a little longer than yours
i guess that was it
you see im three days older than you and that gives me a vantage
im three days older
and this view of the case seemed to cheer billy williams so much that he began to smile on the world again and felt able to swagger a little almost as if he had won the race instead of losing it
somehow ceddie errol had a way of making people feel comfortable
even in the first flush of his triumphs he remembered that the person who was beaten might not feel so gay as he did and might like to think that he might have been the winner under different circumstances
that morning mr havisham had quite a long conversation with the winner of the race  a conversation which made him smile his dry smile and rub his chin with his bony hand several times
mrs errol had been called out of the parlor and the lawyer and cedric were left together
at first mr havisham wondered what he should say to his small companion
he had an idea that perhaps it would be best to say several things which might prepare cedric for meeting his grandfather and perhaps for the great change that was to come to him
he could see that cedric had not the least idea of the sort of thing he was to see when he reached england or of the sort of home that waited for him there
he did not even know yet that his mother was not to live in the same house with him
they had thought it best to let him get over the first shock before telling him
mr havisham sat in an arm chair on one side of the open window on the other side was another still larger chair and cedric sat in that and looked at mr havisham
he sat well back in the depths of his big seat his curly head against the cushioned back his legs crossed and his hands thrust deep into his pockets in a quite mr hobbs like way
he had been watching mr havisham very steadily when his mamma had been in the room and after she was gone he still looked at him in respectful thoughtfulness
there was a short silence after mrs errol went out and cedric seemed to be studying mr havisham and mr havisham was certainly studying cedric
he could not make up his mind as to what an elderly gentleman should say to a little boy who won races and wore short knickerbockers and red stockings on legs which were not long enough to hang over a big chair when he sat well back in it
but cedric relieved him by suddenly beginning the conversation himself
do you know he said i dont know what an earl is
dont you
said mr havisham
no replied ceddie
and i think when a boy is going to be one he ought to know
dont you
well  yes answered mr havisham
would you mind said ceddie respectfully  would you mind plaining it to me
sometimes when he used his long words he did not pronounce them quite correctly
what made him an earl
a king or queen in the first place said mr havisham
generally he is made an earl because he has done some service to his sovereign or some great deed
oh
said cedric that like the president
is it
said mr havisham
is that why your presidents are elected
yes answered ceddie cheerfully
when a man is very good and knows a great deal he is elected president
they have torch light processions and bands and everybody makes speeches
i used to think i might perhaps be a president but i never thought of being an earl
i didnt know about earls he said rather hastily lest mr havisham might feel it impolite in him not to have wished to be one  if id known about them i dare say i should have thought i should like to be one
it is rather different from being a president said mr havisham
is it
asked cedric
how
are there no torch light processions
mr havisham crossed his own legs and put the tips of his fingers carefully together
he thought perhaps the time had come to explain matters rather more clearly
an earl is  is a very important person he began
so is a president
put in ceddie
the torch light processions are five miles long and they shoot up rockets and the band plays
mr hobbs took me to see them
an earl mr havisham went on feeling rather uncertain of his ground is frequently of very ancient lineage     what that
asked ceddie
of very old family  extremely old
ah
said cedric thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets
i suppose that is the way with the apple woman near the park
i dare say she is of ancient lin lenage
she is so old it would surprise you how she can stand up
she a hundred i should think and yet she is out there when it rains even
im sorry for her and so are the other boys
billy williams once had nearly a dollar and i asked him to buy five cents worth of apples from her every day until he had spent it all
that made twenty days and he grew tired of apples after a week but then  it was quite fortunate  a gentleman gave me fifty cents and i bought apples from her instead
you feel sorry for any one that so poor and has such ancient lin lenage
she says hers has gone into her bones and the rain makes it worse
mr havisham felt rather at a loss as he looked at his companion innocent serious little face
i am afraid you did not quite understand me he explained
when i said ancient lineage i did not mean old age i meant that the name of such a family has been known in the world a long time perhaps for hundreds of years persons bearing that name have been known and spoken of in the history of their country
like george washington said ceddie
ive heard of him ever since i was born and he was known about long before that
mr hobbs says he will never be forgotten
that because of the declaration of independence you know and the fourth of july
you see he was a very brave man
the first earl of dorincourt said mr havisham solemnly was created an earl four hundred years ago
well well
said ceddie
that was a long time ago
did you tell dearest that
it would intrust her very much
well tell her when she comes in
she always likes to hear curus things
what else does an earl do besides being created
a great many of them have helped to govern england
some of them have been brave men and have fought in great battles in the old days
i should like to do that myself said cedric
my papa was a soldier and he was a very brave man  as brave as george washington
perhaps that was because he would have been an earl if he hadnt died
i am glad earls are brave
that a great vantage  to be a brave man
once i used to be rather afraid of things  in the dark you know but when i thought about the soldiers in the revolution and george washington  it cured me
there is another advantage in being an earl sometimes said mr havisham slowly and he fixed his shrewd eyes on the little boy with a rather curious expression
some earls have a great deal of money
he was curious because he wondered if his young friend knew what the power of money was
that a good thing to have said ceddie innocently
i wish i had a great deal of money
do you
said mr havisham
and why
well explained cedric there are so many things a person can do with money
you see there the apple woman
if i were very rich i should buy her a little tent to put her stall in and a little stove and then i should give her a dollar every morning it rained so that she could afford to stay at home
and then  oh
id give her a shawl
and you see her bones wouldnt feel so badly
her bones are not like our bones they hurt her when she moves
it very painful when your bones hurt you
if i were rich enough to do all those things for her i guess her bones would be all right
ahem
said mr havisham
and what else would you do if you were rich
oh
id do a great many things
of course i should buy dearest all sorts of beautiful things needle books and fans and gold thimbles and rings and an encyclopedia and a carriage so that she neednt have to wait for the street cars
if she liked pink silk dresses i should buy her some but she likes black best
but id take her to the big stores and tell her to look round and choose for herself
and then dick who is dick
asked mr havisham
dick is a boot black said his young lordship quite warming up in his interest in plans so exciting
he is one of the nicest boot blacks you ever knew
he stands at the corner of a street down town
ive known him for years
once when i was very little i was walking out with dearest and she bought me a beautiful ball that bounced and i was carrying it and it bounced into the middle of the street where the carriages and horses were and i was so disappointed i began to cry  i was very little
i had kilts on
and dick was blacking a man shoes and he said hello
and he ran in between the horses and caught the ball for me and wiped it off with his coat and gave it to me and said it all right young un
so dearest admired him very much and so did i and ever since then when we go down town we talk to him
he says hello
and i say hello
and then we talk a little and he tells me how trade is
it been bad lately
and what would you like to do for him
inquired the lawyer rubbing his chin and smiling a queer smile
well said lord fauntleroy settling himself in his chair with a business air id buy jake out
and who is jake
mr havisham asked
he dick partner and he is the worst partner a fellow could have
dick says so
he isnt a credit to the business and he isnt square
he cheats and that makes dick mad
it would make you mad you know if you were blacking boots as hard as you could and being square all the time and your partner wasnt square at all
people like dick but they dont like jake and so sometimes they dont come twice
so if i were rich id buy jake out and get dick a boss sign  he says a boss sign goes a long way and id get him some new clothes and new brushes and start him out fair
he says all he wants is to start out fair
there could have been nothing more confiding and innocent than the way in which his small lordship told his little story quoting his friend dick bits of slang in the most candid good faith
he seemed to feel not a shade of a doubt that his elderly companion would be just as interested as he was himself
and in truth mr havisham was beginning to be greatly interested but perhaps not quite so much in dick and the apple woman as in this kind little lordling whose curly head was so busy under its yellow thatch with good natured plans for his friends and who seemed somehow to have forgotten himself altogether
is there anything     he began
what would you get for yourself if you were rich
lots of things
answered lord fauntleroy briskly but first id give mary some money for bridget  that her sister with twelve children and a husband out of work
she comes here and cries and dearest gives her things in a basket and then she cries again and says blessin be on yez for a beautiful lady
and i think mr hobbs would like a gold watch and chain to remember me by and a meerschaum pipe
and then id like to get up a company
a company
exclaimed mr havisham
like a republican rally explained cedric becoming quite excited
id have torches and uniforms and things for all the boys and myself too
and wed march you know and drill
that what i should like for myself if i were rich
the door opened and mrs errol came in
i am sorry to have been obliged to leave you so long she said to mr havisham but a poor woman who is in great trouble came to see me
this young gentleman said mr havisham has been telling me about some of his friends and what he would do for them if he were rich
bridget is one of his friends said mrs errol and it is bridget to whom i have been talking in the kitchen
she is in great trouble now because her husband has rheumatic fever
cedric slipped down out of his big chair
i think ill go and see her he said and ask her how he is
he a nice man when he is well
im obliged to him because he once made me a sword out of wood
he a very talented man
he ran out of the room and mr havisham rose from his chair
he seemed to have something in his mind which he wished to speak of
he hesitated a moment and then said looking down at mrs errol before i left dorincourt castle i had an interview with the earl in which he gave me some instructions
he is desirous that his grandson should look forward with some pleasure to his future life in england and also to his acquaintance with himself
he said that i must let his lordship know that the change in his life would bring him money and the pleasures children enjoy if he expressed any wishes i was to gratify them and to tell him that his grand father had given him what he wished
i am aware that the earl did not expect anything quite like this but if it would give lord fauntleroy pleasure to assist this poor woman i should feel that the earl would be displeased if he were not gratified
for the second time he did not repeat the earl exact words
his lordship had indeed said make the lad understand that i can give him anything he wants
let him know what it is to be the grandson of the earl of dorincourt
buy him everything he takes a fancy to let him have money in his pockets and tell him his grandfather put it there
his motives were far from being good and if he had been dealing with a nature less affectionate and warm hearted than little lord fauntleroy great harm might have been done
and cedric mother was too gentle to suspect any harm
she thought that perhaps this meant that a lonely unhappy old man whose children were dead wished to be kind to her little boy and win his love and confidence
and it pleased her very much to think that ceddie would be able to help bridget
it made her happier to know that the very first result of the strange fortune which had befallen her little boy was that he could do kind things for those who needed kindness
quite a warm color bloomed on her pretty young face
oh
she said that was very kind of the earl cedric will be so glad
he has always been fond of bridget and michael
they are quite deserving
i have often wished i had been able to help them more
michael is a hard working man when he is well but he has been ill a long time and needs expensive medicines and warm clothing and nourishing food
he and bridget will not be wasteful of what is given them
mr havisham put his thin hand in his breast pocket and drew forth a large pocket book
there was a queer look in his keen face
the truth was he was wondering what the earl of dorincourt would say when he was told what was the first wish of his grandson that had been granted
he wondered what the cross worldly selfish old nobleman would think of it
i do not know that you have realized he said that the earl of dorincourt is an exceedingly rich man
he can afford to gratify any caprice
i think it would please him to know that lord fauntleroy had been indulged in any fancy
if you will call him back and allow me i shall give him five pounds for these people
that would be twenty five dollars
exclaimed mrs errol
it will seem like wealth to them
i can scarcely believe that it is true
it is quite true said mr havisham with his dry smile
a great change has taken place in your son life a great deal of power will lie in his hands
oh
cried his mother
and he is such a little boy  a very little boy
how can i teach him to use it well
it makes me half afraid
my pretty little ceddie
the lawyer slightly cleared his throat
it touched his worldly hard old heart to see the tender timid look in her brown eyes
i think madam he said that if i may judge from my interview with lord fauntleroy this morning the next earl of dorincourt will think for others as well as for his noble self
he is only a child yet but i think he may be trusted
then his mother went for cedric and brought him back into the parlor
mr havisham heard him talking before he entered the room
it infam natory rheumatism he was saying and that a kind of rheumatism that dreadful
and he thinks about the rent not being paid and bridget says that makes the infammation worse
and pat could get a place in a store if he had some clothes
his little face looked quite anxious when he came in
he was very sorry for bridget
dearest said you wanted me he said to mr havisham
ive been talking to bridget
mr havisham looked down at him a moment
he felt a little awkward and undecided
as cedric mother had said he was a very little boy
the earl of dorincourt     he began and then he glanced involuntarily at mrs errol
little lord fauntleroy mother suddenly kneeled down by him and put both her tender arms around his childish body
ceddie she said the earl is your grandpapa your own papa father
he is very very kind and he loves you and wishes you to love him because the sons who were his little boys are dead
he wishes you to be happy and to make other people happy
he is very rich and he wishes you to have everything you would like to have
he told mr havisham so and gave him a great deal of money for you
you can give some to bridget now enough to pay her rent and buy michael everything
isnt that fine ceddie
isnt he good
and she kissed the child on his round cheek where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement
he looked from his mother to mr havisham
can i have it now
he cried
can i give it to her this minute
she just going
mr havisham handed him the money
it was in fresh clean greenbacks and made a neat roll
ceddie flew out of the room with it
bridget
they heard him shout as he tore into the kitchen
bridget wait a minute
here some money
it for you and you can pay the rent
my grandpapa gave it to me
it for you and michael
oh master ceddie
cried bridget in an awe stricken voice
it twinty foive dollars is here
where be the misthress
i think i shall have to go and explain it to her mrs errol said
so she too went out of the room and mr havisham was left alone for a while
he went to the window and stood looking out into the street reflectively
he was thinking of the old earl of dorincourt sitting in his great splendid gloomy library at the castle gouty and lonely surrounded by grandeur and luxury but not really loved by any one because in all his long life he had never really loved any one but himself he had been selfish and self indulgent and arrogant and passionate he had cared so much for the earl of dorincourt and his pleasures that there had been no time for him to think of other people all his wealth and power all the benefits from his noble name and high rank had seemed to him to be things only to be used to amuse and give pleasure to the earl of dorincourt and now that he was an old man all this excitement and self indulgence had only brought him ill health and irritability and a dislike of the world which certainly disliked him
in spite of all his splendor there was never a more unpopular old nobleman than the earl of dorincourt and there could scarcely have been a more lonely one
he could fill his castle with guests if he chose
he could give great dinners and splendid hunting parties but he knew that in secret the people who would accept his invitations were afraid of his frowning old face and sarcastic biting speeches
he had a cruel tongue and a bitter nature and he took pleasure in sneering at people and making them feel uncomfortable when he had the power to do so because they were sensitive or proud or timid
mr havisham knew his hard fierce ways by heart and he was thinking of him as he looked out of the window into the narrow quiet street
and there rose in his mind in sharp contrast the picture of the cheery handsome little fellow sitting in the big chair and telling his story of his friends dick and the apple woman in his generous innocent honest way
and he thought of the immense income the beautiful majestic estates the wealth and power for good or evil which in the course of time would lie in the small chubby hands little lord fauntleroy thrust so deep into his pockets
it will make a great difference he said to himself
it will make a great difference
cedric and his mother came back soon after
cedric was in high spirits
he sat down in his own chair between his mother and the lawyer and fell into one of his quaint attitudes with his hands on his knees
he was glowing with enjoyment of bridget relief and rapture
she cried
he said
she said she was crying for joy
i never saw any one cry for joy before
my grandpapa must be a very good man
i didnt know he was so good a man
it more  more agreeabler to be an earl than i thought it was
im almost glad  im almost quite glad im going to be one
iii cedric good opinion of the advantages of being an earl increased greatly during the next week
it seemed almost impossible for him to realize that there was scarcely anything he might wish to do which he could not do easily in fact i think it may be said that he did not fully realize it at all
but at least he understood after a few conversations with mr havisham that he could gratify all his nearest wishes and he proceeded to gratify them with a simplicity and delight which caused mr havisham much diversion
in the week before they sailed for england he did many curious things
the lawyer long after remembered the morning they went down town together to pay a visit to dick and the afternoon they so amazed the apple woman of ancient lineage by stopping before her stall and telling her she was to have a tent and a stove and a shawl and a sum of money which seemed to her quite wonderful
for i have to go to england and be a lord explained cedric sweet temperedly
and i shouldnt like to have your bones on my mind every time it rained
my own bones never hurt so i think i dont know how painful a person bones can be but ive sympathized with you a great deal and i hope youll be better
she a very good apple woman he said to mr havisham as they walked away leaving the proprietress of the stall almost gasping for breath and not at all believing in her great fortune
once when i fell down and cut my knee she gave me an apple for nothing
ive always remembered her for it
you know you always remember people who are kind to you
it had never occurred to his honest simple little mind that there were people who could forget kindnesses
the interview with dick was quite exciting
dick had just been having a great deal of trouble with jake and was in low spirits when they saw him
his amazement when cedric calmly announced that they had come to give him what seemed a very great thing to him and would set all his troubles right almost struck him dumb
lord fauntleroy manner of announcing the object of his visit was very simple and unceremonious
mr havisham was much impressed by its directness as he stood by and listened
the statement that his old friend had become a lord and was in danger of being an earl if he lived long enough caused dick to so open his eyes and mouth and start that his cap fell off
when he picked it up he uttered a rather singular exclamation
mr havisham thought it singular but cedric had heard it before
i soy
he said whatre yer givin us
this plainly embarrassed his lordship a little but he bore himself bravely
everybody thinks it not true at first he said
mr hobbs thought id had a sunstroke
i didnt think i was going to like it myself but i like it better now im used to it
the one who is the earl now he my grandpapa and he wants me to do anything i like
he very kind if he is an earl and he sent me a lot of money by mr havisham and ive brought some to you to buy jake out
and the end of the matter was that dick actually bought jake out and found himself the possessor of the business and some new brushes and a most astonishing sign and outfit
he could not believe in his good luck any more easily than the apple woman of ancient lineage could believe in hers he walked about like a boot black in a dream he stared at his young benefactor and felt as if he might wake up at any moment
he scarcely seemed to realize anything until cedric put out his hand to shake hands with him before going away
well good bye he said and though he tried to speak steadily there was a little tremble in his voice and he winked his big brown eyes
and i hope tradell be good
im sorry im going away to leave you but perhaps i shall come back again when im an earl
and i wish youd write to me because we were always good friends
and if you write to me here where you must send your letter
and he gave him a slip of paper
and my name isnt cedric errol any more it lord fauntleroy and  and good bye dick
dick winked his eyes also and yet they looked rather moist about the lashes
he was not an educated boot black and he would have found it difficult to tell what he felt just then if he had tried perhaps that was why he didnt try and only winked his eyes and swallowed a lump in his throat
i wish ye wasnt goin away he said in a husky voice
then he winked his eyes again
then he looked at mr havisham and touched his cap
thanky sir fur bringin him down here an fur wot yeve done he  he a queer little feller he added
ive allers thort a heap of him
he such a game little feller an  an such a queer little un
and when they turned away he stood and looked after them in a dazed kind of way and there was still a mist in his eyes and a lump in his throat as he watched the gallant little figure marching gayly along by the side of its tall rigid escort
until the day of his departure his lordship spent as much time as possible with mr hobbs in the store
gloom had settled upon mr hobbs he was much depressed in spirits
when his young friend brought to him in triumph the parting gift of a gold watch and chain mr hobbs found it difficult to acknowledge it properly
he laid the case on his stout knee and blew his nose violently several times
there something written on it said cedric  inside the case
i told the man myself what to say
from his oldest friend lord fauntleroy to mr hobbs
when this you see remember me
i dont want you to forget me
mr hobbs blew his nose very loudly again
i shant forget you he said speaking a trifle huskily as dick had spoken nor dont you go and forget me when you get among the british arrystocracy
i shouldnt forget you whoever i was among answered his lordship
ive spent my happiest hours with you at least some of my happiest hours
i hope youll come to see me sometime
im sure my grandpapa would be very much pleased
perhaps hell write and ask you when i tell him about you
you  you wouldnt mind his being an earl would you i mean you wouldnt stay away just because he was one if he invited you to come
id come to see you replied mr hobbs graciously
so it seemed to be agreed that if he received a pressing invitation from the earl to come and spend a few months at dorincourt castle he was to lay aside his republican prejudices and pack his valise at once
at last all the preparations were complete the day came when the trunks were taken to the steamer and the hour arrived when the carriage stood at the door
then a curious feeling of loneliness came upon the little boy
his mamma had been shut up in her room for some time when she came down the stairs her eyes looked large and wet and her sweet mouth was trembling
cedric went to her and she bent down to him and he put his arms around her and they kissed each other
he knew something made them both sorry though he scarcely knew what it was but one tender little thought rose to his lips
we liked this little house dearest didnt we
he said
we always will like it wont we
yes  yes she answered in a low sweet voice
yes darling
and then they went into the carriage and cedric sat very close to her and as she looked back out of the window he looked at her and stroked her hand and held it close
and then it seemed almost directly they were on the steamer in the midst of the wildest bustle and confusion carriages were driving down and leaving passengers passengers were getting into a state of excitement about baggage which had not arrived and threatened to be too late big trunks and cases were being bumped down and dragged about sailors were uncoiling ropes and hurrying to and fro officers were giving orders ladies and gentlemen and children and nurses were coming on board  some were laughing and looked gay some were silent and sad here and there two or three were crying and touching their eyes with their handkerchiefs
cedric found something to interest him on every side he looked at the piles of rope at the furled sails at the tall tall masts which seemed almost to touch the hot blue sky he began to make plans for conversing with the sailors and gaining some information on the subject of pirates
it was just at the very last when he was standing leaning on the railing of the upper deck and watching the final preparations enjoying the excitement and the shouts of the sailors and wharfmen that his attention was called to a slight bustle in one of the groups not far from him
some one was hurriedly forcing his way through this group and coming toward him
it was a boy with something red in his hand
it was dick
he came up to cedric quite breathless
ive run all the way he said
ive come down to see ye off
trade been prime
i bought this for ye out o what i made yesterday
ye kin wear it when ye get among the swells
i lost the paper when i was tryin to get through them fellers downstairs
they didnt want to let me up
it a hankercher
he poured it all forth as if in one sentence
a bell rang and he made a leap away before cedric had time to speak
good bye
he panted
wear it when ye get among the swells
and he darted off and was gone
a few seconds later they saw him struggle through the crowd on the lower deck and rush on shore just before the gang plank was drawn in
he stood on the wharf and waved his cap
cedric held the handkerchief in his hand
it was of bright red silk ornamented with purple horseshoes and horses heads
there was a great straining and creaking and confusion
the people on the wharf began to shout to their friends and the people on the steamer shouted back good bye
good bye
good bye old fellow
every one seemed to be saying dont forget us
write when you get to liverpool
good bye
good bye
little lord fauntleroy leaned forward and waved the red handkerchief
good bye dick
he shouted lustily
thank you
good bye dick
and the big steamer moved away and the people cheered again and cedric mother drew the veil over her eyes and on the shore there was left great confusion but dick saw nothing save that bright childish face and the bright hair that the sun shone on and the breeze lifted and he heard nothing but the hearty childish voice calling good bye dick
as little lord fauntleroy steamed slowly away from the home of his birth to the unknown land of his ancestors
iv it was during the voyage that cedric mother told him that his home was not to be hers and when he first understood it his grief was so great that mr havisham saw that the earl had been wise in making the arrangements that his mother should be quite near him and see him often for it was very plain he could not have borne the separation otherwise
but his mother managed the little fellow so sweetly and lovingly and made him feel that she would be so near him that after a while he ceased to be oppressed by the fear of any real parting
my house is not far from the castle ceddie she repeated each time the subject was referred to  a very little way from yours and you can always run in and see me every day and you will have so many things to tell me
and we shall be so happy together
it is a beautiful place
your papa has often told me about it
he loved it very much and you will love it too
i should love it better if you were there his small lordship said with a heavy little sigh
he could not but feel puzzled by so strange a state of affairs which could put his dearest in one house and himself in another
the fact was that mrs errol had thought it better not to tell him why this plan had been made
i should prefer he should not be told she said to mr havisham
he would not really understand he would only be shocked and hurt and i feel sure that his feeling for the earl will be a more natural and affectionate one if he does not know that his grandfather dislikes me so bitterly
he has never seen hatred or hardness and it would be a great blow to him to find out that any one could hate me
he is so loving himself and i am so dear to him
it is better for him that he should not be told until he is much older and it is far better for the earl
it would make a barrier between them even though ceddie is such a child
so cedric only knew that there was some mysterious reason for the arrangement some reason which he was not old enough to understand but which would be explained when he was older
he was puzzled but after all it was not the reason he cared about so much and after many talks with his mother in which she comforted him and placed before him the bright side of the picture the dark side of it gradually began to fade out though now and then mr havisham saw him sitting in some queer little old fashioned attitude watching the sea with a very grave face and more than once he heard an unchildish sigh rise to his lips
i dont like it he said once as he was having one of his almost venerable talks with the lawyer
you dont know how much i dont like it but there are a great many troubles in this world and you have to bear them
mary says so and ive heard mr hobbs say it too
and dearest wants me to like to live with my grandpapa because you see all his children are dead and that very mournful
it makes you sorry for a man when all his children have died  and one was killed suddenly
one of the things which always delighted the people who made the acquaintance of his young lordship was the sage little air he wore at times when he gave himself up to conversation  combined with his occasionally elderly remarks and the extreme innocence and seriousness of his round childish face it was irresistible
he was such a handsome blooming curly headed little fellow that when he sat down and nursed his knee with his chubby hands and conversed with much gravity he was a source of great entertainment to his hearers
gradually mr havisham had begun to derive a great deal of private pleasure and amusement from his society
and so you are going to try to like the earl he said
yes answered his lordship
he my relation and of course you have to like your relations and besides he been very kind to me
when a person does so many things for you and wants you to have everything you wish for of course youd like him if he wasnt your relation but when he your relation and does that why youre very fond of him
do you think suggested mr havisham that he will be fond of you
well said cedric i think he will because you see im his relation too and im his boy little boy besides and well dont you see  of course he must be fond of me now or he wouldnt want me to have everything that i like and he wouldnt have sent you for me
oh
remarked the lawyer that it is it
yes said cedric that it
dont you think that it too
of course a man would be fond of his grandson
the people who had been seasick had no sooner recovered from their seasickness and come on deck to recline in their steamer chairs and enjoy themselves than every one seemed to know the romantic story of little lord fauntleroy and every one took an interest in the little fellow who ran about the ship or walked with his mother or the tall thin old lawyer or talked to the sailors
every one liked him he made friends everywhere
he was ever ready to make friends
when the gentlemen walked up and down the deck and let him walk with them he stepped out with a manly sturdy little tramp and answered all their jokes with much gay enjoyment when the ladies talked to him there was always laughter in the group of which he was the center when he played with the children there was always magnificent fun on hand
among the sailors he had the heartiest friends he heard miraculous stories about pirates and shipwrecks and desert islands he learned to splice ropes and rig toy ships and gained an amount of information concerning topsls and mainsls quite surprising
his conversation had indeed quite a nautical flavor at times and on one occasion he raised a shout of laughter in a group of ladies and gentlemen who were sitting on deck wrapped in shawls and overcoats by saying sweetly and with a very engaging expression shiver my timbers but it a cold day
it surprised him when they laughed
he had picked up this sea faring remark from an elderly naval man of the name of jerry who told him stories in which it occurred frequently
to judge from his stories of his own adventures jerry had made some two or three thousand voyages and had been invariably shipwrecked on each occasion on an island densely populated with bloodthirsty cannibals
judging also by these same exciting adventures he had been partially roasted and eaten frequently and had been scalped some fifteen or twenty times
that is why he is so bald explained lord fauntleroy to his mamma
after you have been scalped several times the hair never grows again
jerry never grew again after that last time when the king of the parromachaweekins did it with the knife made out of the skull of the chief of the wopslemumpkies
he says it was one of the most serious times he ever had
he was so frightened that his hair stood right straight up when the king flourished his knife and it never would lie down and the king wears it that way now and it looks something like a hair brush
i never heard anything like the asperiences jerry has had
i should so like to tell mr hobbs about them
sometimes when the weather was very disagreeable and people were kept below decks in the saloon a party of his grown up friends would persuade him to tell them some of these asperiences of jerry and as he sat relating them with great delight and fervor there was certainly no more popular voyager on any ocean steamer crossing the atlantic than little lord fauntleroy
he was always innocently and good naturedly ready to do his small best to add to the general entertainment and there was a charm in the very unconsciousness of his own childish importance
jerry stories intrust them very much he said to his mamma
for my part  you must excuse me dearest  but sometimes i should have thought they couldnt be all quite true if they hadnt happened to jerry himself but as they all happened to jerry  well it very strange you know and perhaps sometimes he may forget and be a little mistaken as he been scalped so often
being scalped a great many times might make a person forgetful
it was eleven days after he had said good bye to his friend dick before he reached liverpool and it was on the night of the twelfth day that the carriage in which he and his mother and mr havisham had driven from the station stopped before the gates of court lodge
they could not see much of the house in the darkness
cedric only saw that there was a drive way under great arching trees and after the carriage had rolled down this drive way a short distance he saw an open door and a stream of bright light coming through it
mary had come with them to attend her mistress and she had reached the house before them
when cedric jumped out of the carriage he saw one or two servants standing in the wide bright hall and mary stood in the door way
lord fauntleroy sprang at her with a gay little shout
did you get here mary
he said
here mary dearest and he kissed the maid on her rough red cheek
i am glad you are here mary mrs errol said to her in a low voice
it is such a comfort to me to see you
it takes the strangeness away
and she held out her little hand which mary squeezed encouragingly
she knew how this first strangeness must feel to this little mother who had left her own land and was about to give up her child
the english servants looked with curiosity at both the boy and his mother
they had heard all sorts of rumors about them both they knew how angry the old earl had been and why mrs errol was to live at the lodge and her little boy at the castle they knew all about the great fortune he was to inherit and about the savage old grandfather and his gout and his tempers
hell have no easy time of it poor little chap they had said among themselves
but they did not know what sort of a little lord had come among them they did not quite understand the character of the next earl of dorincourt
he pulled off his overcoat quite as if he were used to doing things for himself and began to look about him
he looked about the broad hall at the pictures and stags antlers and curious things that ornamented it
they seemed curious to him because he had never seen such things before in a private house
dearest he said this is a very pretty house isnt it
i am glad you are going to live here
it quite a large house
it was quite a large house compared to the one in the shabby new york street and it was very pretty and cheerful
mary led them upstairs to a bright chintz hung bedroom where a fire was burning and a large snow white persian cat was sleeping luxuriously on the white fur hearth rug
it was the house kaper up at the castle maam sint her to yez explained mary
it herself is a kind hearted lady an has had iverything done to prepar fur yez
i seen her meself a few minnits an she was fond av the captin maam an graivs fur him and she said to say the big cat slapin on the rug moight make the room same homeloike to yez
she knowed captin errol whin he was a bye  an a foine handsum bye she ses he was an a foine young man wid a plisint word fur every one great an shmall
an ses i to her ses i he lift a bye that loike him maam fur a foiner little felly niver sthipped in shoe leather
when they were ready they went downstairs into another big bright room its ceiling was low and the furniture was heavy and beautifully carved the chairs were deep and had high massive backs and there were queer shelves and cabinets with strange pretty ornaments on them
there was a great tiger skin before the fire and an arm chair on each side of it
the stately white cat had responded to lord fauntleroy stroking and followed him downstairs and when he threw himself down upon the rug she curled herself up grandly beside him as if she intended to make friends
cedric was so pleased that he put his head down by hers and lay stroking her not noticing what his mother and mr havisham were saying
they were indeed speaking in a rather low tone
mrs errol looked a little pale and agitated
he need not go to night
she said
he will stay with me to night
yes answered mr havisham in the same low tone it will not be necessary for him to go to night
i myself will go to the castle as soon as we have dined and inform the earl of our arrival
mrs errol glanced down at cedric
he was lying in a graceful careless attitude upon the black and yellow skin the fire shone on his handsome flushed little face and on the tumbled curly hair spread out on the rug the big cat was purring in drowsy content  she liked the caressing touch of the kind little hand on her fur
mrs errol smiled faintly
his lordship does not know all that he is taking from me she said rather sadly
then she looked at the lawyer
will you tell him if you please she said that i should rather not have the money
the money
mr havisham exclaimed
you can not mean the income he proposed to settle upon you
yes she answered quite simply i think i should rather not have it
i am obliged to accept the house and i thank him for it because it makes it possible for me to be near my child but i have a little money of my own  enough to live simply upon  and i should rather not take the other
as he dislikes me so much i should feel a little as if i were selling cedric to him
i am giving him up only because i love him enough to forget myself for his good and because his father would wish it to be so
mr havisham rubbed his chin
this is very strange he said
he will be very angry
he wont understand it
i think he will understand it after he thinks it over she said
i do not really need the money and why should i accept luxuries from the man who hates me so much that he takes my little boy from me  his son child
mr havisham looked reflective for a few moments
i will deliver your message he said afterward
and then the dinner was brought in and they sat down together the big cat taking a seat on a chair near cedric and purring majestically throughout the meal
when later in the evening mr havisham presented himself at the castle he was taken at once to the earl
he found him sitting by the fire in a luxurious easy chair his foot on a gout stool
he looked at the lawyer sharply from under his shaggy eyebrows but mr havisham could see that in spite of his pretense at calmness he was nervous and secretly excited
well he said well havisham come back have you
what the news
lord fauntleroy and his mother are at court lodge replied mr havisham
they bore the voyage very well and are in excellent health
the earl made a half impatient sound and moved his hand restlessly
glad to hear it he said brusquely
so far so good
make yourself comfortable
have a glass of wine and settle down
what else
his lordship remains with his mother to night
to morrow i will bring him to the castle
the earl elbow was resting on the arm of his chair he put his hand up and shielded his eyes with it
well he said go on
you know i told you not to write to me about the matter and i know nothing whatever about it
what kind of a lad is he
i dont care about the mother what sort of a lad is he
mr havisham drank a little of the glass of port he had poured out for himself and sat holding it in his hand
it is rather difficult to judge of the character of a child of seven he said cautiously
the earl prejudices were very intense
he looked up quickly and uttered a rough word
a fool is he
he exclaimed
or a clumsy cub
his american blood tells does it
i do not think it has injured him my lord replied the lawyer in his dry deliberate fashion
i dont know much about children but i thought him rather a fine lad
his manner of speech was always deliberate and unenthusiastic but he made it a trifle more so than usual
he had a shrewd fancy that it would be better that the earl should judge for himself and be quite unprepared for his first interview with his grandson
healthy and well grown
asked my lord
apparently very healthy and quite well grown replied the lawyer
straight limbed and well enough to look at
demanded the earl
a very slight smile touched mr havisham thin lips
there rose up before his mind eye the picture he had left at court lodge  the beautiful graceful child body lying upon the tiger skin in careless comfort  the bright tumbled hair spread on the rug  the bright rosy boy face
rather a handsome boy i think my lord as boys go he said though i am scarcely a judge perhaps
but you will find him somewhat different from most english children i dare say
i havent a doubt of that snarled the earl a twinge of gout seizing him
a lot of impudent little beggars those american children ive heard that often enough
it is not exactly impudence in his case said mr havisham
i can scarcely describe what the difference is
he has lived more with older people than with children and the difference seems to be a mixture of maturity and childishness
american impudence
protested the earl
ive heard of it before
they call it precocity and freedom
beastly impudent bad manners that what it is
mr havisham drank some more port
he seldom argued with his lordly patron  never when his lordly patron noble leg was inflamed by gout
at such times it was always better to leave him alone
so there was a silence of a few moments
it was mr havisham who broke it
i have a message to deliver from mrs errol he remarked
i dont want any of her messages
growled his lordship the less i hear of her the better
this is a rather important one explained the lawyer
she prefers not to accept the income you proposed to settle on her
the earl started visibly
what that
he cried out
what that
mr havisham repeated his words
she says it is not necessary and that as the relations between you are not friendly     not friendly
ejaculated my lord savagely i should say they were not friendly
i hate to think of her
a mercenary sharp voiced american
i dont wish to see her
my lord said mr havisham you can scarcely call her mercenary
she has asked for nothing
she does not accept the money you offer her
all done for effect
snapped his noble lordship
she wants to wheedle me into seeing her
she thinks i shall admire her spirit
i dont admire it
it only american independence
i wont have her living like a beggar at my park gates
as she the boy mother she has a position to keep up and she shall keep it up
she shall have the money whether she likes it or not
she wont spend it said mr havisham
i dont care whether she spends it or not
blustered my lord
she shall have it sent to her
she shant tell people that she has to live like a pauper because i have done nothing for her
she wants to give the boy a bad opinion of me
i suppose she has poisoned his mind against me already
no said mr havisham
i have another message which will prove to you that she has not done that
i dont want to hear it
panted the earl out of breath with anger and excitement and gout
but mr havisham delivered it
she asks you not to let lord fauntleroy hear anything which would lead him to understand that you separate him from her because of your prejudice against her
he is very fond of her and she is convinced that it would cause a barrier to exist between you
she says he would not comprehend it and it might make him fear you in some measure or at least cause him to feel less affection for you
she has told him that he is too young to understand the reason but shall hear it when he is older
she wishes that there should be no shadow on your first meeting
the earl sank back into his chair
his deep set fierce old eyes gleamed under his beetling brows
come now
he said still breathlessly
come now
you dont mean the mother hasnt told him
not one word my lord replied the lawyer coolly
that i can assure you
the child is prepared to believe you the most amiable and affectionate of grandparents
nothing  absolutely nothing has been said to him to give him the slightest doubt of your perfection
and as i carried out your commands in every detail while in new york he certainly regards you as a wonder of generosity
he does eh
said the earl
i give you my word of honor said mr havisham that lord fauntleroy impressions of you will depend entirely upon yourself
and if you will pardon the liberty i take in making the suggestion i think you will succeed better with him if you take the precaution not to speak slightingly of his mother
pooh pooh
said the earl
the youngster is only seven years old
he has spent those seven years at his mother side returned mr havisham and she has all his affection
v it was late in the afternoon when the carriage containing little lord fauntleroy and mr havisham drove up the long avenue which led to the castle
the earl had given orders that his grandson should arrive in time to dine with him and for some reason best known to himself he had also ordered that the child should be sent alone into the room in which he intended to receive him
as the carriage rolled up the avenue lord fauntleroy sat leaning comfortably against the luxurious cushions and regarded the prospect with great interest
he was in fact interested in everything he saw
he had been interested in the carriage with its large splendid horses and their glittering harness he had been interested in the tall coachman and footman with their resplendent livery and he had been especially interested in the coronet on the panels and had struck up an acquaintance with the footman for the purpose of inquiring what it meant
when the carriage reached the great gates of the park he looked out of the window to get a good view of the huge stone lions ornamenting the entrance
the gates were opened by a motherly rosy looking woman who came out of a pretty ivy covered lodge
two children ran out of the door of the house and stood looking with round wide open eyes at the little boy in the carriage who looked at them also
their mother stood courtesying and smiling and the children on receiving a sign from her made bobbing little courtesies too
does she know me
asked lord fauntleroy
i think she must think she knows me
and he took off his black velvet cap to her and smiled
how do you do
he said brightly
good afternoon
the woman seemed pleased he thought
the smile broadened on her rosy face and a kind look came into her blue eyes
god bless your lordship
she said
god bless your pretty face
good luck and happiness to your lordship
welcome to you
lord fauntleroy waved his cap and nodded to her again as the carriage rolled by her
i like that woman he said
she looks as if she liked boys
i should like to come here and play with her children
i wonder if she has enough to make up a company
mr havisham did not tell him that he would scarcely be allowed to make playmates of the gate keeper children
the lawyer thought there was time enough for giving him that information
the carriage rolled on and on between the great beautiful trees which grew on each side of the avenue and stretched their broad swaying branches in an arch across it
cedric had never seen such trees  they were so grand and stately and their branches grew so low down on their huge trunks
he did not then know that dorincourt castle was one of the most beautiful in all england that its park was one of the broadest and finest and its trees and avenue almost without rivals
but he did know that it was all very beautiful
he liked the big broad branched trees with the late afternoon sunlight striking golden lances through them
he liked the perfect stillness which rested on everything
he felt a great strange pleasure in the beauty of which he caught glimpses under and between the sweeping boughs  the great beautiful spaces of the park with still other trees standing sometimes stately and alone and sometimes in groups
now and then they passed places where tall ferns grew in masses and again and again the ground was azure with the bluebells swaying in the soft breeze
several times he started up with a laugh of delight as a rabbit leaped up from under the greenery and scudded away with a twinkle of short white tail behind it
once a covey of partridges rose with a sudden whir and flew away and then he shouted and clapped his hands
it a beautiful place isnt it
he said to mr havisham
i never saw such a beautiful place
it prettier even than central park
he was rather puzzled by the length of time they were on their way
how far is it he said at length from the gate to the front door
it is between three and four miles answered the lawyer
that a long way for a person to live from his gate remarked his lordship
every few minutes he saw something new to wonder at and admire
when he caught sight of the deer some couched in the grass some standing with their pretty antlered heads turned with a half startled air toward the avenue as the carriage wheels disturbed them he was enchanted
has there been a circus
he cried or do they live here always
whose are they
they live here mr havisham told him
they belong to the earl your grandfather
it was not long after this that they saw the castle
it rose up before them stately and beautiful and gray the last rays of the sun casting dazzling lights on its many windows
it had turrets and battlements and towers a great deal of ivy grew upon its walls all the broad open space about it was laid out in terraces and lawns and beds of brilliant flowers
it the most beautiful place i ever saw
said cedric his round face flushing with pleasure
it reminds any one of a king palace
i saw a picture of one once in a fairy book
he saw the great entrance door thrown open and many servants standing in two lines looking at him
he wondered why they were standing there and admired their liveries very much
he did not know that they were there to do honor to the little boy to whom all this splendor would one day belong  the beautiful castle like the fairy king palace the magnificent park the grand old trees the dells full of ferns and bluebells where the hares and rabbits played the dappled large eyed deer couching in the deep grass
it was only a couple of weeks since he had sat with mr hobbs among the potatoes and canned peaches with his legs dangling from the high stool it would not have been possible for him to realize that he had very much to do with all this grandeur
at the head of the line of servants there stood an elderly woman in a rich plain black silk gown she had gray hair and wore a cap
as he entered the hall she stood nearer than the rest and the child thought from the look in her eyes that she was going to speak to him
mr havisham who held his hand paused a moment
this is lord fauntleroy mrs mellon he said
lord fauntleroy this is mrs mellon who is the housekeeper
cedric gave her his hand his eyes lighting up
was it you who sent the cat
he said
im much obliged to you maam
mrs mellon handsome old face looked as pleased as the face of the lodge keeper wife had done
i should know his lordship anywhere she said to mr havisham
he has the captain face and way
it a great day this sir
cedric wondered why it was a great day
he looked at mrs mellon curiously
it seemed to him for a moment as if there were tears in her eyes and yet it was evident she was not unhappy
she smiled down on him
the cat left two beautiful kittens here she said they shall be sent up to your lordship nursery
mr havisham said a few words to her in a low voice
in the library sir mrs mellon replied
his lordship is to be taken there alone
a few minutes later the very tall footman in livery who had escorted cedric to the library door opened it and announced lord fauntleroy my lord in quite a majestic tone
if he was only a footman he felt it was rather a grand occasion when the heir came home to his own land and possessions and was ushered into the presence of the old earl whose place and title he was to take
cedric crossed the threshold into the room
it was a very large and splendid room with massive carven furniture in it and shelves upon shelves of books the furniture was so dark and the draperies so heavy the diamond paned windows were so deep and it seemed such a distance from one end of it to the other that since the sun had gone down the effect of it all was rather gloomy
for a moment cedric thought there was nobody in the room but soon he saw that by the fire burning on the wide hearth there was a large easy chair and that in that chair some one was sitting  some one who did not at first turn to look at him
but he had attracted attention in one quarter at least
on the floor by the arm chair lay a dog a huge tawny mastiff with body and limbs almost as big as a lion and this great creature rose majestically and slowly and marched toward the little fellow with a heavy step
then the person in the chair spoke
dougal he called come back sir
but there was no more fear in little lord fauntleroy heart than there was unkindness  he had been a brave little fellow all his life
he put his hand on the big dog collar in the most natural way in the world and they strayed forward together dougal sniffing as he went
and then the earl looked up
what cedric saw was a large old man with shaggy white hair and eyebrows and a nose like an eagle beak between his deep fierce eyes
what the earl saw was a graceful childish figure in a black velvet suit with a lace collar and with love locks waving about the handsome manly little face whose eyes met his with a look of innocent good fellowship
if the castle was like the palace in a fairy story it must be owned that little lord fauntleroy was himself rather like a small copy of the fairy prince though he was not at all aware of the fact and perhaps was rather a sturdy young model of a fairy
but there was a sudden glow of triumph and exultation in the fiery old earl heart as he saw what a strong beautiful boy this grandson was and how unhesitatingly he looked up as he stood with his hand on the big dog neck
it pleased the grim old nobleman that the child should show no shyness or fear either of the dog or of himself
cedric looked at him just as he had looked at the woman at the lodge and at the housekeeper and came quite close to him
are you the earl
he said
im your grandson you know that mr havisham brought
im lord fauntleroy
he held out his hand because he thought it must be the polite and proper thing to do even with earls
i hope you are very well he continued with the utmost friendliness
im very glad to see you
the earl shook hands with him with a curious gleam in his eyes just at first he was so astonished that he scarcely knew what to say
he stared at the picturesque little apparition from under his shaggy brows and took it all in from head to foot
glad to see me are you
he said
yes answered lord fauntleroy very
there was a chair near him and he sat down on it it was a high backed rather tall chair and his feet did not touch the floor when he had settled himself in it but he seemed to be quite comfortable as he sat there and regarded his august relative intently but modestly
ive kept wondering what you would look like he remarked
i used to lie in my berth in the ship and wonder if you would be anything like my father
am i
asked the earl
well cedric replied i was very young when he died and i may not remember exactly how he looked but i dont think you are like him
you are disappointed i suppose
suggested his grandfather
oh no responded cedric politely
of course you would like any one to look like your father but of course you would enjoy the way your grandfather looked even if he wasnt like your father
you know how it is yourself about admiring your relations
the earl leaned back in his chair and stared
he could not be said to know how it was about admiring his relations
he had employed most of his noble leisure in quarreling violently with them in turning them out of his house and applying abusive epithets to them and they all hated him cordially
any boy would love his grandfather continued lord fauntleroy especially one that had been as kind to him as you have been
another queer gleam came into the old nobleman eyes
oh
he said i have been kind to you have i
yes answered lord fauntleroy brightly im ever so much obliged to you about bridget and the apple woman and dick
bridget
exclaimed the earl
dick
the apple woman
yes
explained cedric the ones you gave me all that money for  the money you told mr havisham to give me if i wanted it
ha
ejaculated his lordship
that it is it
the money you were to spend as you liked
what did you buy with it
i should like to hear something about that
he drew his shaggy eyebrows together and looked at the child sharply
he was secretly curious to know in what way the lad had indulged himself
oh
said lord fauntleroy perhaps you didnt know about dick and the apple woman and bridget
i forgot you lived such a long way off from them
they were particular friends of mine
and you see michael had the fever     who michael
asked the earl
michael is bridget husband and they were in great trouble
when a man is sick and cant work and has twelve children you know how it is
and michael has always been a sober man
and bridget used to come to our house and cry
and the evening mr havisham was there she was in the kitchen crying because they had almost nothing to eat and couldnt pay the rent and i went in to see her and mr havisham sent for me and he said you had given him some money for me
and i ran as fast as i could into the kitchen and gave it to bridget and that made it all right and bridget could scarcely believe her eyes
that why im so obliged to you
oh
said the earl in his deep voice that was one of the things you did for yourself was it
what else
dougal had been sitting by the tall chair the great dog had taken its place there when cedric sat down
several times it had turned and looked up at the boy as if interested in the conversation
dougal was a solemn dog who seemed to feel altogether too big to take life responsibilities lightly
the old earl who knew the dog well had watched it with secret interest
dougal was not a dog whose habit it was to make acquaintances rashly and the earl wondered somewhat to see how quietly the brute sat under the touch of the childish hand
and just at this moment the big dog gave little lord fauntleroy one more look of dignified scrutiny and deliberately laid its huge lion like head on the boy black velvet knee
the small hand went on stroking this new friend as cedric answered well there was dick he said
youd like dick he so square
this was an americanism the earl was not prepared for
what does that mean
he inquired
lord fauntleroy paused a moment to reflect
he was not very sure himself what it meant
he had taken it for granted as meaning something very creditable because dick had been fond of using it
i think it means that he wouldnt cheat any one he exclaimed or hit a boy who was under his size and that he blacks people boots very well and makes them shine as much as he can
he a perfessional bootblack
and he one of your acquaintances is he
said the earl
he is an old friend of mine replied his grandson
not quite as old as mr hobbs but quite old
he gave me a present just before the ship sailed
he put his hand into his pocket and drew forth a neatly folded red object and opened it with an air of affectionate pride
it was the red silk handkerchief with the large purple horse shoes and heads on it
he gave me this said his young lordship
i shall keep it always
you can wear it round your neck or keep it in your pocket
he bought it with the first money he earned after i bought jake out and gave him the new brushes
it a keepsake
i put some poetry in mr hobbs watch
it was when this you see remember me
when this i see i shall always remember dick
the sensations of the right honorable the earl of dorincourt could scarcely be described
he was not an old nobleman who was very easily bewildered because he had seen a great deal of the world but here was something he found so novel that it almost took his lordly breath away and caused him some singular emotions
he had never cared for children he had been so occupied with his own pleasures that he had never had time to care for them
his own sons had not interested him when they were very young  though sometimes he remembered having thought cedric father a handsome and strong little fellow
he had been so selfish himself that he had missed the pleasure of seeing unselfishness in others and he had not known how tender and faithful and affectionate a kind hearted little child can be and how innocent and unconscious are its simple generous impulses
a boy had always seemed to him a most objectionable little animal selfish and greedy and boisterous when not under strict restraint his own two eldest sons had given their tutors constant trouble and annoyance and of the younger one he fancied he had heard few complaints because the boy was of no particular importance
it had never once occurred to him that he should like his grandson he had sent for the little cedric because his pride impelled him to do so
if the boy was to take his place in the future he did not wish his name to be made ridiculous by descending to an uneducated boor
he had been convinced the boy would be a clownish fellow if he were brought up in america
he had no feeling of affection for the lad his only hope was that he should find him decently well featured and with a respectable share of sense he had been so disappointed in his other sons and had been made so furious by captain errol american marriage that he had never once thought that anything creditable could come of it
when the footman had announced lord fauntleroy he had almost dreaded to look at the boy lest he should find him all that he had feared
it was because of this feeling that he had ordered that the child should be sent to him alone
his pride could not endure that others should see his disappointment if he was to be disappointed
his proud stubborn old heart therefore had leaped within him when the boy came forward with his graceful easy carriage his fearless hand on the big dog neck
even in the moments when he had hoped the most the earl had never hoped that his grandson would look like that
it seemed almost too good to be true that this should be the boy he had dreaded to see  the child of the woman he so disliked  this little fellow with so much beauty and such a brave childish grace
the earl stern composure was quite shaken by this startling surprise
and then their talk began and he was still more curiously moved and more and more puzzled
in the first place he was so used to seeing people rather afraid and embarrassed before him that he had expected nothing else but that his grandson would be timid or shy
but cedric was no more afraid of the earl than he had been of dougal
he was not bold he was only innocently friendly and he was not conscious that there could be any reason why he should be awkward or afraid
the earl could not help seeing that the little boy took him for a friend and treated him as one without having any doubt of him at all
it was quite plain as the little fellow sat there in his tall chair and talked in his friendly way that it had never occurred to him that this large fierce looking old man could be anything but kind to him and rather pleased to see him there
and it was plain too that in his childish way he wished to please and interest his grandfather
cross and hard hearted and worldly as the old earl was he could not help feeling a secret and novel pleasure in this very confidence
after all it was not disagreeable to meet some one who did not distrust him or shrink from him or seem to detect the ugly part of his nature some one who looked at him with clear unsuspecting eyes  if it was only a little boy in a black velvet suit
so the old man leaned back in his chair and led his young companion on to telling him still more of himself and with that odd gleam in his eyes watched the little fellow as he talked
lord fauntleroy was quite willing to answer all his questions and chatted on in his genial little way quite composedly
he told him all about dick and jake and the apple woman and mr hobbs he described the republican rally in all the glory of its banners and transparencies torches and rockets
in the course of the conversation he reached the fourth of july and the revolution and was just becoming enthusiastic when he suddenly recollected something and stopped very abruptly
what is the matter
demanded his grandfather
why dont you go on
lord fauntleroy moved rather uneasily in his chair
it was evident to the earl that he was embarrassed by the thought which had just occurred to him
i was just thinking that perhaps you mightnt like it he replied
perhaps some one belonging to you might have been there
i forgot you were an englishman
you can go on said my lord
no one belonging to me was there
you forgot you were an englishman too
oh
no said cedric quickly
im an american
you are an englishman said the earl grimly
your father was an englishman
it amused him a little to say this but it did not amuse cedric
the lad had never thought of such a development as this
he felt himself grow quite hot up to the roots of his hair
i was born in america he protested
you have to be an american if you are born in america
i beg your pardon with serious politeness and delicacy for contradicting you
mr hobbs told me if there were another war you know i should have to  to be an american
the earl gave a grim half laugh  it was short and grim but it was a laugh
you would would you
he said
he hated america and americans but it amused him to see how serious and interested this small patriot was
he thought that so good an american might make a rather good englishman when he was a man
they had not time to go very deep into the revolution again  and indeed lord fauntleroy felt some delicacy about returning to the subject  before dinner was announced
cedric left his chair and went to his noble kinsman
he looked down at his gouty foot
would you like me to help you
he said politely
you could lean on me you know
once when mr hobbs hurt his foot with a potato barrel rolling on it he used to lean on me
the big footman almost periled his reputation and his situation by smiling
he was an aristocratic footman who had always lived in the best of noble families and he had never smiled indeed he would have felt himself a disgraced and vulgar footman if he had allowed himself to be led by any circumstance whatever into such an indiscretion as a smile
but he had a very narrow escape
he only just saved himself by staring straight over the earl head at a very ugly picture
the earl looked his valiant young relative over from head to foot
do you think you could do it
he asked gruffly
i think i could said cedric
im strong
im seven you know
you could lean on your stick on one side and on me on the other
dick says ive a good deal of muscle for a boy that only seven
he shut his hand and moved it upward to his shoulder so that the earl might see the muscle dick had kindly approved of and his face was so grave and earnest that the footman found it necessary to look very hard indeed at the ugly picture
well said the earl you may try
cedric gave him his stick and began to assist him to rise
usually the footman did this and was violently sworn at when his lordship had an extra twinge of gout
the earl was not a very polite person as a rule and many a time the huge footmen about him quaked inside their imposing liveries
but this evening he did not swear though his gouty foot gave him more twinges than one
he chose to try an experiment
he got up slowly and put his hand on the small shoulder presented to him with so much courage
little lord fauntleroy made a careful step forward looking down at the gouty foot
just lean on me he said with encouraging good cheer
ill walk very slowly
if the earl had been supported by the footman he would have rested less on his stick and more on his assistant arm
and yet it was part of his experiment to let his grandson feel his burden as no light weight
it was quite a heavy weight indeed and after a few steps his young lordship face grew quite hot and his heart beat rather fast but he braced himself sturdily remembering his muscle and dick approval of it
dont be afraid of leaning on me he panted
im all right  if  if it isnt a very long way
it was not really very far to the dining room but it seemed rather a long way to cedric before they reached the chair at the head of the table
the hand on his shoulder seemed to grow heavier at every step and his face grew redder and hotter and his breath shorter but he never thought of giving up he stiffened his childish muscles held his head erect and encouraged the earl as he limped along
does your foot hurt you very much when you stand on it
he asked
did you ever put it in hot water and mustard
mr hobbs used to put his in hot water
arnica is a very nice thing they tell me
the big dog stalked slowly beside them and the big footman followed several times he looked very queer as he watched the little figure making the very most of all its strength and bearing its burden with such good will
the earl too looked rather queer once as he glanced sidewise down at the flushed little face
when they entered the room where they were to dine cedric saw it was a very large and imposing one and that the footman who stood behind the chair at the head of the table stared very hard as they came in
but they reached the chair at last
the hand was removed from his shoulder and the earl was fairly seated
cedric took out dick handkerchief and wiped his forehead
it a warm night isnt it
he said
perhaps you need a fire because  because of your foot but it seems just a little warm to me
his delicate consideration for his noble relative feelings was such that he did not wish to seem to intimate that any of his surroundings were unnecessary
you have been doing some rather hard work said the earl
oh no
said lord fauntleroy it wasnt exactly hard but i got a little warm
a person will get warm in summer time
and he rubbed his damp curls rather vigorously with the gorgeous handkerchief
his own chair was placed at the other end of the table opposite his grandfather
it was a chair with arms and intended for a much larger individual than himself indeed everything he had seen so far  the great rooms with their high ceilings the massive furniture the big footman the big dog the earl himself  were all of proportions calculated to make this little lad feel that he was very small indeed
but that did not trouble him he had never thought himself very large or important and he was quite willing to accommodate himself even to circumstances which rather overpowered him
perhaps he had never looked so little a fellow as when seated now in his great chair at the end of the table
notwithstanding his solitary existence the earl chose to live in some state
he was fond of his dinner and he dined in a formal style
cedric looked at him across a glitter of splendid glass and plate which to his unaccustomed eyes seemed quite dazzling
a stranger looking on might well have smiled at the picture  the great stately room the big liveried servants the bright lights the glittering silver and glass the fierce looking old nobleman at the head of the table and the very small boy at the foot
dinner was usually a very serious matter with the earl  and it was a very serious matter with the cook if his lordship was not pleased or had an indifferent appetite
to day however his appetite seemed a trifle better than usual perhaps because he had something to think of beside the flavor of the entrees and the management of the gravies
his grandson gave him something to think of
he kept looking at him across the table
he did not say very much himself but he managed to make the boy talk
he had never imagined that he could be entertained by hearing a child talk but lord fauntleroy at once puzzled and amused him and he kept remembering how he had let the childish shoulder feel his weight just for the sake of trying how far the boy courage and endurance would go and it pleased him to know that his grandson had not quailed and had not seemed to think even for a moment of giving up what he had undertaken to do
you dont wear your coronet all the time
remarked lord fauntleroy respectfully
no replied the earl with his grim smile it is not becoming to me
mr hobbs said you always wore it said cedric but after he thought it over he said he supposed you must sometimes take it off to put your hat on
yes said the earl i take it off occasionally
and one of the footmen suddenly turned aside and gave a singular little cough behind his hand
cedric finished his dinner first and then he leaned back in his chair and took a survey of the room
you must be very proud of your house he said it such a beautiful house
i never saw anything so beautiful but of course as im only seven i havent seen much
and you think i must be proud of it do you
said the earl
i should think any one would be proud of it replied lord fauntleroy
i should be proud of it if it were my house
everything about it is beautiful
and the park and those trees  how beautiful they are and how the leaves rustle
then he paused an instant and looked across the table rather wistfully
it a very big house for just two people to live in isnt it
he said
it is quite large enough for two answered the earl
do you find it too large
his little lordship hesitated a moment
i was only thinking he said that if two people lived in it who were not very good companions they might feel lonely sometimes
do you think i shall make a good companion
inquired the earl
yes replied cedric i think you will
mr hobbs and i were great friends
he was the best friend i had except dearest
the earl made a quick movement of his bushy eyebrows
who is dearest
she is my mother said lord fauntleroy in a rather low quiet little voice
perhaps he was a trifle tired as his bed time was nearing and perhaps after the excitement of the last few days it was natural he should be tired so perhaps too the feeling of weariness brought to him a vague sense of loneliness in the remembrance that to night he was not to sleep at home watched over by the loving eyes of that best friend of his
they had always been best friends this boy and his young mother
he could not help thinking of her and the more he thought of her the less was he inclined to talk and by the time the dinner was at an end the earl saw that there was a faint shadow on his face
but cedric bore himself with excellent courage and when they went back to the library though the tall footman walked on one side of his master the earl hand rested on his grandson shoulder though not so heavily as before
when the footman left them alone cedric sat down upon the hearth rug near dougal
for a few minutes he stroked the dog ears in silence and looked at the fire
the earl watched him
the boy eyes looked wistful and thoughtful and once or twice he gave a little sigh
the earl sat still and kept his eyes fixed on his grandson
fauntleroy he said at last what are you thinking of
fauntleroy looked up with a manful effort at a smile
i was thinking about dearest he said and  and i think id better get up and walk up and down the room
he rose up and put his hands in his small pockets and began to walk to and fro
his eyes were very bright and his lips were pressed together but he kept his head up and walked firmly
dougal moved lazily and looked at him and then stood up
he walked over to the child and began to follow him uneasily
fauntleroy drew one hand from his pocket and laid it on the dog head
he a very nice dog he said
he my friend
he knows how i feel
how do you feel
asked the earl
it disturbed him to see the struggle the little fellow was having with his first feeling of homesickness but it pleased him to see that he was making so brave an effort to bear it well
he liked this childish courage
come here he said
fauntleroy went to him
i never was away from my own house before said the boy with a troubled look in his brown eyes
it makes a person feel a strange feeling when he has to stay all night in another person castle instead of in his own house
but dearest is not very far away from me
she told me to remember that  and  and im seven  and i can look at the picture she gave me
he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a small violet velvet covered case
this is it he said
you see you press this spring and it opens and she is in there
he had come close to the earl chair and as he drew forth the little case he leaned against the arm of it and against the old man arm too as confidingly as if children had always leaned there
there she is he said as the case opened and he looked up with a smile
the earl knitted his brows he did not wish to see the picture but he looked at it in spite of himself and there looked up at him from it such a pretty young face  a face so like the child at his side  that it quite startled him
i suppose you think you are very fond of her he said
yes answered lord fauntleroy in a gentle tone and with simple directness i do think so and i think it true
you see mr hobbs was my friend and dick and bridget and mary and michael they were my friends too but dearest  well she is my close friend and we always tell each other everything
my father left her to me to take care of and when i am a man i am going to work and earn money for her
what do you think of doing
inquired his grandfather
his young lordship slipped down upon the hearth rug and sat there with the picture still in his hand
he seemed to be reflecting seriously before he answered
i did think perhaps i might go into business with mr hobbs he said but i should like to be a president
well send you to the house of lords instead said his grandfather
well remarked lord fauntleroy if i couldnt be a president and if that is a good business i shouldnt mind
the grocery business is dull sometimes
perhaps he was weighing the matter in his mind for he sat very quiet after this and looked at the fire for some time
the earl did not speak again
he leaned back in his chair and watched him
a great many strange new thoughts passed through the old nobleman mind
dougal had stretched himself out and gone to sleep with his head on his huge paws
there was a long silence
in about half an hour time mr havisham was ushered in
the great room was very still when he entered
the earl was still leaning back in his chair
he moved as mr havisham approached and held up his hand in a gesture of warning  it seemed as if he had scarcely intended to make the gesture  as if it were almost involuntary
dougal was still asleep and close beside the great dog sleeping also with his curly head upon his arm lay little lord fauntleroy
vi when lord fauntleroy wakened in the morning  he had not wakened at all when he had been carried to bed the night before  the first sounds he was conscious of were the crackling of a wood fire and the murmur of voices
you will be careful dawson not to say anything about it he heard some one say
he does not know why she is not to be with him and the reason is to be kept from him
if them his lordship orders mem another voice answered theyll have to be kep i suppose
but if youll excuse the liberty mem as it between ourselves servant or no servant all i have to say is it a cruel thing  parting that poor pretty young widdered cretur from her own flesh and blood and him such a little beauty and a nobleman born
james and thomas mem last night in the servants hall they both of em say as they never see anythink in their two lives  nor yet no other gentleman in livery  like that little fellow ways as innercent an polite an interested as if hed been sitting there dining with his best friend  and the temper of a angel instead of one if youll excuse me mem as it well known is enough to curdle your blood in your veins at times
and as to looks mem when we was rung for james and me to go into the library and bring him upstairs and james lifted him up in his arms what with his little innercent face all red and rosy and his little head on james shoulder and his hair hanging down all curly an shinin a prettier takiner sight youd never wish to see
an it my opinion my lord wasnt blind to it neither for he looked at him and he says to james ee you dont wake him
he says
cedric moved on his pillow and turned over opening his eyes
there were two women in the room
everything was bright and cheerful with gay flowered chintz
there was a fire on the hearth and the sunshine was streaming in through the ivy entwined windows
both women came toward him and he saw that one of them was mrs mellon the housekeeper and the other a comfortable middle aged woman with a face as kind and good humored as a face could be
good morning my lord said mrs mellon
did you sleep well
his lordship rubbed his eyes and smiled
good morning he said
i didnt know i was here
you were carried upstairs when you were asleep said the housekeeper
this is your bedroom and this is dawson who is to take care of you
fauntleroy sat up in bed and held out his hand to dawson as he had held it out to the earl
how do you do maam
he said
im much obliged to you for coming to take care of me
you can call her dawson my lord said the housekeeper with a smile
she is used to being called dawson
miss dawson or mrs dawson
inquired his lordship
just dawson my lord said dawson herself beaming all over
neither miss nor missis bless your little heart
will you get up now and let dawson dress you and then have your breakfast in the nursery
i learned to dress myself many years ago thank you answered fauntleroy
dearest taught me
dearest is my mamma
we had only mary to do all the work  washing and all  and so of course it wouldnt do to give her so much trouble
i can take my bath too pretty well if youll just be kind enough to zamine the corners after im done
dawson and the housekeeper exchanged glances
dawson will do anything you ask her to said mrs mellon
that i will bless him said dawson in her comforting good humored voice
he shall dress himself if he likes and ill stand by ready to help him if he wants me
thank you responded lord fauntleroy it a little hard sometimes about the buttons you know and then i have to ask somebody
he thought dawson a very kind woman and before the bath and the dressing were finished they were excellent friends and he had found out a great deal about her
he had discovered that her husband had been a soldier and had been killed in a real battle and that her son was a sailor and was away on a long cruise and that he had seen pirates and cannibals and chinese people and turks and that he brought home strange shells and pieces of coral which dawson was ready to show at any moment some of them being in her trunk
all this was very interesting
he also found out that she had taken care of little children all her life and that she had just come from a great house in another part of england where she had been taking care of a beautiful little girl whose name was lady gwyneth vaughn
and she is a sort of relation of your lordship said dawson
and perhaps sometime you may see her
do you think i shall
said fauntleroy
i should like that
i never knew any little girls but i always like to look at them
when he went into the adjoining room to take his breakfast and saw what a great room it was and found there was another adjoining it which dawson told him was his also the feeling that he was very small indeed came over him again so strongly that he confided it to dawson as he sat down to the table on which the pretty breakfast service was arranged
i am a very little boy he said rather wistfully to live in such a large castle and have so many big rooms  dont you think so
oh
come
said dawson you feel just a little strange at first that all but youll get over that very soon and then youll like it here
it such a beautiful place you know
it a very beautiful place of course said fauntleroy with a little sigh but i should like it better if i didnt miss dearest so
i always had my breakfast with her in the morning and put the sugar and cream in her tea for her and handed her the toast
that made it very sociable of course
oh well
answered dawson comfortingly you know you can see her every day and there no knowing how much youll have to tell her
bless you
wait till youve walked about a bit and seen things  the dogs and the stables with all the horses in them
there one of them i know youll like to see     is there
exclaimed fauntleroy im very fond of horses
i was very fond of jim
he was the horse that belonged to mr hobbs grocery wagon
he was a beautiful horse when he wasnt balky
well said dawson you just wait till youve seen what in the stables
and deary me you havent looked even into the very next room yet
what is there
asked fauntleroy
wait until youve had your breakfast and then you shall see said dawson
at this he naturally began to grow curious and he applied himself assiduously to his breakfast
it seemed to him that there must be something worth looking at in the next room dawson had such a consequential mysterious air
now then he said slipping off his seat a few minutes later ive had enough
can i go and look at it
dawson nodded and led the way looking more mysterious and important than ever
he began to be very much interested indeed
when she opened the door of the room he stood upon the threshold and looked about him in amazement
he did not speak he only put his hands in his pockets and stood there flushing up to his forehead and looking in
he flushed up because he was so surprised and for the moment excited
to see such a place was enough to surprise any ordinary boy
the room was a large one too as all the rooms seemed to be and it appeared to him more beautiful than the rest only in a different way
the furniture was not so massive and antique as was that in the rooms he had seen downstairs the draperies and rugs and walls were brighter there were shelves full of books and on the tables were numbers of toys  beautiful ingenious things  such as he had looked at with wonder and delight through the shop windows in new york
it looks like a boy room he said at last catching his breath a little
whom do they belong to
go and look at them said dawson
they belong to you
to me
he cried to me
why do they belong to me
who gave them to me
and he sprang forward with a gay little shout
it seemed almost too much to be believed
it was grandpapa
he said with his eyes as bright as stars
i know it was grandpapa
yes it was his lordship said dawson and if you will be a nice little gentleman and not fret about things and will enjoy yourself and be happy all the day he will give you anything you ask for
it was a tremendously exciting morning
there were so many things to be examined so many experiments to be tried each novelty was so absorbing that he could scarcely turn from it to look at the next
and it was so curious to know that all this had been prepared for himself alone that even before he had left new york people had come down from london to arrange the rooms he was to occupy and had provided the books and playthings most likely to interest him
did you ever know any one he said to dawson who had such a kind grandfather
dawson face wore an uncertain expression for a moment
she had not a very high opinion of his lordship the earl
she had not been in the house many days but she had been there long enough to hear the old nobleman peculiarities discussed very freely in the servants hall
an of all the wicious savage hill tempered hold fellows it was ever my hill luck to wear livery hunder the tallest footman had said he the wiolentest and wust by a long shot
and this particular footman whose name was thomas had also repeated to his companions below stairs some of the earl remarks to mr havisham when they had been discussing these very preparations
give him his own way and fill his rooms with toys my lord had said
give him what will amuse him and hell forget about his mother quickly enough
amuse him and fill his mind with other things and we shall have no trouble
that boy nature
so perhaps having had this truly amiable object in view it did not please him so very much to find it did not seem to be exactly this particular boy nature
the earl had passed a bad night and had spent the morning in his room but at noon after he had lunched he sent for his grandson
fauntleroy answered the summons at once
he came down the broad staircase with a bounding step the earl heard him run across the hall and then the door opened and he came in with red cheeks and sparkling eyes
i was waiting for you to send for me he said
i was ready a long time ago
im ever so much obliged to you for all those things
im ever so much obliged to you
i have been playing with them all the morning
oh
said the earl you like them do you
i like them so much  well i couldnt tell you how much
said fauntleroy his face glowing with delight
there one that like baseball only you play it on a board with black and white pegs and you keep your score with some counters on a wire
i tried to teach dawson but she couldnt quite understand it just at first  you see she never played baseball being a lady and im afraid i wasnt very good at explaining it to her
but you know all about it dont you
im afraid i dont replied the earl
it an american game isnt it
is it something like cricket
i never saw cricket said fauntleroy but mr hobbs took me several times to see baseball
it a splendid game
you get so excited
would you like me to go and get my game and show it to you
perhaps it would amuse you and make you forget about your foot
does your foot hurt you very much this morning
more than i enjoy was the answer
then perhaps you couldnt forget it said the little fellow anxiously
perhaps it would bother you to be told about the game
do you think it would amuse you or do you think it would bother you
go and get it said the earl
it certainly was a novel entertainment this  making a companion of a child who offered to teach him to play games  but the very novelty of it amused him
there was a smile lurking about the earl mouth when cedric came back with the box containing the game in his arms and an expression of the most eager interest on his face
may i pull that little table over here to your chair
he asked
ring for thomas said the earl
he will place it for you
oh i can do it myself answered fauntleroy
it not very heavy
very well replied his grandfather
the lurking smile deepened on the old man face as he watched the little fellow preparations there was such an absorbed interest in them
the small table was dragged forward and placed by his chair and the game taken from its box and arranged upon it
it very interesting when you once begin said fauntleroy
you see the black pegs can be your side and the white ones mine
theyre men you know and once round the field is a home run and counts one  and these are the outs  and here is the first base and that the second and that the third and that the home base
he entered into the details of explanation with the greatest animation
he showed all the attitudes of pitcher and catcher and batter in the real game and gave a dramatic description of a wonderful hot ball he had seen caught on the glorious occasion on which he had witnessed a match in company with mr hobbs
his vigorous graceful little body his eager gestures his simple enjoyment of it all were pleasant to behold
when at last the explanations and illustrations were at an end and the game began in good earnest the earl still found himself entertained
his young companion was wholly absorbed he played with all his childish heart his gay little laughs when he made a good throw his enthusiasm over a home run his impartial delight over his own good luck and his opponent would have given a flavor to any game
if a week before any one had told the earl of dorincourt that on that particular morning he would be forgetting his gout and his bad temper in a child game played with black and white wooden pegs on a gayly painted board with a curly headed small boy for a companion he would without doubt have made himself very unpleasant and yet he certainly had forgotten himself when the door opened and thomas announced a visitor
the visitor in question who was an elderly gentleman in black and no less a person than the clergyman of the parish was so startled by the amazing scene which met his eye that he almost fell back a pace and ran some risk of colliding with thomas
there was in fact no part of his duty that the reverend mr mordaunt found so decidedly unpleasant as that part which compelled him to call upon his noble patron at the castle
his noble patron indeed usually made these visits as disagreeable as it lay in his lordly power to make them
he abhorred churches and charities and flew into violent rages when any of his tenantry took the liberty of being poor and ill and needing assistance
when his gout was at its worst he did not hesitate to announce that he would not be bored and irritated by being told stories of their miserable misfortunes when his gout troubled him less and he was in a somewhat more humane frame of mind he would perhaps give the rector some money after having bullied him in the most painful manner and berated the whole parish for its shiftlessness and imbecility
but whatsoever his mood he never failed to make as many sarcastic and embarrassing speeches as possible and to cause the reverend mr mordaunt to wish it were proper and christian like to throw something heavy at him
during all the years in which mr mordaunt had been in charge of dorincourt parish the rector certainly did not remember having seen his lordship of his own free will do any one a kindness or under any circumstances whatever show that he thought of any one but himself
he had called to day to speak to him of a specially pressing case and as he had walked up the avenue he had for two reasons dreaded his visit more than usual
in the first place he knew that his lordship had for several days been suffering with the gout and had been in so villainous a humor that rumors of it had even reached the village  carried there by one of the young women servants to her sister who kept a little shop and retailed darning needles and cotton and peppermints and gossip as a means of earning an honest living
what mrs dibble did not know about the castle and its inmates and the farm houses and their inmates and the village and its population was really not worth being talked about
and of course she knew everything about the castle because her sister jane shorts was one of the upper housemaids and was very friendly and intimate with thomas
and the way his lordship do go on
said mrs dibble over the counter and the way he do use language mr thomas told jane herself no flesh and blood as is in livery could stand  for throw a plate of toast at mr thomas hisself he did not more than two days since and if it werent for other things being agreeable and the society below stairs most genteel warning would have been gave within a hour
and the rector had heard all this for somehow the earl was a favorite black sheep in the cottages and farm houses and his bad behavior gave many a good woman something to talk about when she had company to tea
and the second reason was even worse because it was a new one and had been talked about with the most excited interest
who did not know of the old nobleman fury when his handsome son the captain had married the american lady
who did not know how cruelly he had treated the captain and how the big gay sweet smiling young man who was the only member of the grand family any one liked had died in a foreign land poor and unforgiven
who did not know how fiercely his lordship had hated the poor young creature who had been this son wife and how he had hated the thought of her child and never meant to see the boy  until his two sons died and left him without an heir
and then who did not know that he had looked forward without any affection or pleasure to his grandson coming and that he had made up his mind that he should find the boy a vulgar awkward pert american lad more likely to disgrace his noble name than to honor it
the proud angry old man thought he had kept all his thoughts secret
he did not suppose any one had dared to guess at much less talk over what he felt and dreaded but his servants watched him and read his face and his ill humors and fits of gloom and discussed them in the servants hall
and while he thought himself quite secure from the common herd thomas was telling jane and the cook and the butler and the housemaids and the other footmen that it was his opinion that the hold man was wuss than usual a thinkin hover the capting boy an hanticipatin as he wont be no credit to the fambly
an serve him right added thomas hit is hown fault
wot can he iggspect from a child brought up in pore circumstances in that there low hamerica
and as the reverend mr mordaunt walked under the great trees he remembered that this questionable little boy had arrived at the castle only the evening before and that there were nine chances to one that his lordship worst fears were realized and twenty two chances to one that if the poor little fellow had disappointed him the earl was even now in a tearing rage and ready to vent all his rancor on the first person who called  which it appeared probable would be his reverend self
judge then of his amazement when as thomas opened the library door his ears were greeted by a delighted ring of childish laughter
that two out
shouted an excited clear little voice
you see it two out
and there was the earl chair and the gout stool and his foot on it and by him a small table and a game on it and quite close to him actually leaning against his arm and his ungouty knee was a little boy with face glowing and eyes dancing with excitement
it two out
the little stranger cried
you hadnt any luck that time had you
and then they both recognized at once that some one had come in
the earl glanced around knitting his shaggy eyebrows as he had a trick of doing and when he saw who it was mr mordaunt was still more surprised to see that he looked even less disagreeable than usual instead of more so
in fact he looked almost as if he had forgotten for the moment how disagreeable he was and how unpleasant he really could make himself when he tried
ah
he said in his harsh voice but giving his hand rather graciously
good morning mordaunt
ive found a new employment you see
he put his other hand on cedric shoulder  perhaps deep down in his heart there was a stir of gratified pride that it was such an heir he had to present there was a spark of something like pleasure in his eyes as he moved the boy slightly forward
this is the new lord fauntleroy he said
fauntleroy this is mr mordaunt the rector of the parish
fauntleroy looked up at the gentleman in the clerical garments and gave him his hand
i am very glad to make your acquaintance sir he said remembering the words he had heard mr hobbs use on one or two occasions when he had been greeting a new customer with ceremony
cedric felt quite sure that one ought to be more than usually polite to a minister
mr mordaunt held the small hand in his a moment as he looked down at the child face smiling involuntarily
he liked the little fellow from that instant  as in fact people always did like him
and it was not the boy beauty and grace which most appealed to him it was the simple natural kindliness in the little lad which made any words he uttered however quaint and unexpected sound pleasant and sincere
as the rector looked at cedric he forgot to think of the earl at all
nothing in the world is so strong as a kind heart and somehow this kind little heart though it was only the heart of a child seemed to clear all the atmosphere of the big gloomy room and make it brighter
i am delighted to make your acquaintance lord fauntleroy said the rector
you made a long journey to come to us
a great many people will be glad to know you made it safely
it was a long way answered fauntleroy but dearest my mother was with me and i wasnt lonely
of course you are never lonely if your mother is with you and the ship was beautiful
take a chair mordaunt said the earl
mr mordaunt sat down
he glanced from fauntleroy to the earl
your lordship is greatly to be congratulated he said warmly
but the earl plainly had no intention of showing his feelings on the subject
he is like his father he said rather gruffly
let us hope hell conduct himself more creditably
and then he added well what is it this morning mordaunt
who is in trouble now
this was not as bad as mr mordaunt had expected but he hesitated a second before he began
it is higgins he said higgins of edge farm
he has been very unfortunate
he was ill himself last autumn and his children had scarlet fever
i cant say that he is a very good manager but he has had ill luck and of course he is behindhand in many ways
he is in trouble about his rent now
newick tells him if he doesnt pay it he must leave the place and of course that would be a very serious matter
his wife is ill and he came to me yesterday to beg me to see about it and ask you for time
he thinks if you would give him time he could catch up again
they all think that said the earl looking rather black
fauntleroy made a movement forward
he had been standing between his grandfather and the visitor listening with all his might
he had begun to be interested in higgins at once
he wondered how many children there were and if the scarlet fever had hurt them very much
his eyes were wide open and were fixed upon mr mordaunt with intent interest as that gentleman went on with the conversation
higgins is a well meaning man said the rector making an effort to strengthen his plea
he is a bad enough tenant replied his lordship
and he is always behindhand newick tells me
he is in great trouble now said the rector
he is very fond of his wife and children and if the farm is taken from him they may literally starve
he can not give them the nourishing things they need
two of the children were left very low after the fever and the doctor orders for them wine and luxuries that higgins can not afford
at this fauntleroy moved a step nearer
that was the way with michael he said
the earl slightly started
i forgot you
he said
i forgot we had a philanthropist in the room
who was michael
and the gleam of queer amusement came back into the old man deep set eyes
he was bridget husband who had the fever answered fauntleroy and he couldnt pay the rent or buy wine and things
and you gave me that money to help him
the earl drew his brows together into a curious frown which somehow was scarcely grim at all
he glanced across at mr mordaunt
i dont know what sort of landed proprietor he will make he said
i told havisham the boy was to have what he wanted  anything he wanted  and what he wanted it seems was money to give to beggars
oh
but they werent beggars said fauntleroy eagerly
michael was a splendid bricklayer
they all worked
oh
said the earl they were not beggars
they were splendid bricklayers and bootblacks and apple women
he bent his gaze on the boy for a few seconds in silence
the fact was that a new thought was coming to him and though perhaps it was not prompted by the noblest emotions it was not a bad thought
come here he said at last
fauntleroy went and stood as near to him as possible without encroaching on the gouty foot
what would you do in this case
his lordship asked
it must be confessed that mr mordaunt experienced for the moment a curious sensation
being a man of great thoughtfulness and having spent so many years on the estate of dorincourt knowing the tenantry rich and poor the people of the village honest and industrious dishonest and lazy he realized very strongly what power for good or evil would be given in the future to this one small boy standing there his brown eyes wide open his hands deep in his pockets and the thought came to him also that a great deal of power might perhaps through the caprice of a proud self indulgent old man be given to him now and that if his young nature were not a simple and generous one it might be the worst thing that could happen not only for others but for himself
and what would you do in such a case
demanded the earl
fauntleroy drew a little nearer and laid one hand on his knee with the most confiding air of good comradeship
if i were very rich he said and not only just a little boy i should let him stay and give him the things for his children but then i am only a boy
then after a second pause in which his face brightened visibly you can do anything cant you
he said
humph
said my lord staring at him
that your opinion is it
and he was not displeased either
i mean you can give any one anything said fauntleroy
who newick
he is my agent answered the earl and some of my tenants are not over fond of him
are you going to write him a letter now
inquired fauntleroy
shall i bring you the pen and ink
i can take the game off this table
it plainly had not for an instant occurred to him that newick would be allowed to do his worst
the earl paused a moment still looking at him
can you write
he asked
yes answered cedric but not very well
move the things from the table commanded my lord and bring the pen and ink and a sheet of paper from my desk
mr mordaunt interest began to increase
fauntleroy did as he was told very deftly
in a few moments the sheet of paper the big inkstand and the pen were ready
there
he said gayly now you can write it
you are to write it said the earl
i
exclaimed fauntleroy and a flush overspread his forehead
will it do if i write it
i dont always spell quite right when i havent a dictionary and nobody tells me
it will do answered the earl
higgins will not complain of the spelling
im not the philanthropist you are
dip your pen in the ink
fauntleroy took up the pen and dipped it in the ink bottle then he arranged himself in position leaning on the table
now he inquired what must i say
you may say higgins is not to be interfered with for the present and sign it fauntleroy said the earl
fauntleroy dipped his pen in the ink again and resting his arm began to write
it was rather a slow and serious process but he gave his whole soul to it
after a while however the manuscript was complete and he handed it to his grandfather with a smile slightly tinged with anxiety
do you think it will do
he asked
the earl looked at it and the corners of his mouth twitched a little
yes he answered higgins will find it entirely satisfactory
and he handed it to mr mordaunt
what mr mordaunt found written was this dear mr newik if you pleas mr higins is not to be intur feared with for the present and oblige
yours rispecferly fauntleroy
mr hobbs always signed his letters that way said fauntleroy and i thought id better say please
is that exactly the right way to spell interfered
it not exactly the way it is spelled in the dictionary answered the earl
i was afraid of that said fauntleroy
i ought to have asked
you see that the way with words of more than one syllable you have to look in the dictionary
it always safest
ill write it over again
and write it over again he did making quite an imposing copy and taking precautions in the matter of spelling by consulting the earl himself
spelling is a curious thing he said
it so often different from what you expect it to be
i used to think please was spelled p l e e s but it isnt you know and youd think dear was spelled d e r e if you didnt inquire
sometimes it almost discourages you
when mr mordaunt went away he took the letter with him and he took something else with him also  namely a pleasanter feeling and a more hopeful one than he had ever carried home with him down that avenue on any previous visit he had made at dorincourt castle
when he was gone fauntleroy who had accompanied him to the door went back to his grandfather
may i go to dearest now
he asked
i think she will be waiting for me
the earl was silent a moment
there is something in the stable for you to see first he said
ring the bell
if you please said fauntleroy with his quick little flush
im very much obliged but i think id better see it to morrow
she will be expecting me all the time
very well answered the earl
we will order the carriage
then he added dryly it a pony
fauntleroy drew a long breath
a pony
he exclaimed
whose pony is it
yours replied the earl
mine
cried the little fellow
mine  like the things upstairs
yes said his grandfather
would you like to see it
shall i order it to be brought around
fauntleroy cheeks grew redder and redder
i never thought i should have a pony
he said
i never thought that
how glad dearest will be
you give me everything dont you
do you wish to see it
inquired the earl
fauntleroy drew a long breath
i want to see it he said
i want to see it so much i can hardly wait
but im afraid there isnt time
you must go and see your mother this afternoon
asked the earl
you think you cant put it off
why said fauntleroy she has been thinking about me all the morning and i have been thinking about her
oh
said the earl
you have have you
ring the bell
as they drove down the avenue under the arching trees he was rather silent
but fauntleroy was not
he talked about the pony
what color was it
how big was it
what was its name
what did it like to eat best
how old was it
how early in the morning might he get up and see it
dearest will be so glad
he kept saying
she will be so much obliged to you for being so kind to me
she knows i always liked ponies so much but we never thought i should have one
there was a little boy on fifth avenue who had one and he used to ride out every morning and we used to take a walk past his house to see him
he leaned back against the cushions and regarded the earl with rapt interest for a few minutes and in entire silence
i think you must be the best person in the world he burst forth at last
you are always doing good arent you
and thinking about other people
dearest says that is the best kind of goodness not to think about yourself but to think about other people
that is just the way you are isnt it
his lordship was so dumfounded to find himself presented in such agreeable colors that he did not know exactly what to say
he felt that he needed time for reflection
to see each of his ugly selfish motives changed into a good and generous one by the simplicity of a child was a singular experience
fauntleroy went on still regarding him with admiring eyes  those great clear innocent eyes
you make so many people happy he said
there michael and bridget and their ten children and the apple woman and dick and mr hobbs and mr higgins and mrs higgins and their children and mr mordaunt  because of course he was glad  and dearest and me about the pony and all the other things
do you know ive counted it up on my fingers and in my mind and it twenty seven people youve been kind to
that a good many  twenty seven
and i was the person who was kind to them  was i
said the earl
why yes you know answered fauntleroy
you made them all happy
do you know with some delicate hesitation that people are sometimes mistaken about earls when they dont know them
mr hobbs was
i am going to write him and tell him about it
what was mr hobbs opinion of earls
asked his lordship
well you see the difficulty was replied his young companion that he didnt know any and hed only read about them in books
he thought  you mustnt mind it  that they were gory tyrants and he said he wouldnt have them hanging around his store
but if hed known you im sure he would have felt quite different
i shall tell him about you
what shall you tell him
i shall tell him said fauntleroy glowing with enthusiasm that you are the kindest man i ever heard of
and you are always thinking of other people and making them happy and  and i hope when i grow up i shall be just like you
just like me
repeated his lordship looking at the little kindling face
and a dull red crept up under his withered skin and he suddenly turned his eyes away and looked out of the carriage window at the great beech trees with the sun shining on their glossy red brown leaves
just like you said fauntleroy adding modestly if i can
perhaps im not good enough but im going to try
the carriage rolled on down the stately avenue under the beautiful broad branched trees through the spaces of green shade and lanes of golden sunlight
fauntleroy saw again the lovely places where the ferns grew high and the bluebells swayed in the breeze he saw the deer standing or lying in the deep grass turn their large startled eyes as the carriage passed and caught glimpses of the brown rabbits as they scurried away
he heard the whir of the partridges and the calls and songs of the birds and it all seemed even more beautiful to him than before
all his heart was filled with pleasure and happiness in the beauty that was on every side
but the old earl saw and heard very different things though he was apparently looking out too
he saw a long life in which there had been neither generous deeds nor kind thoughts he saw years in which a man who had been young and strong and rich and powerful had used his youth and strength and wealth and power only to please himself and kill time as the days and years succeeded each other he saw this man when the time had been killed and old age had come solitary and without real friends in the midst of all his splendid wealth he saw people who disliked or feared him and people who would flatter and cringe to him but no one who really cared whether he lived or died unless they had something to gain or lose by it
he looked out on the broad acres which belonged to him and he knew what fauntleroy did not  how far they extended what wealth they represented and how many people had homes on their soil
and he knew too  another thing fauntleroy did not  that in all those homes humble or well to do there was probably not one person however much he envied the wealth and stately name and power and however willing he would have been to possess them who would for an instant have thought of calling the noble owner good or wishing as this simple souled little boy had to be like him
and it was not exactly pleasant to reflect upon even for a cynical worldly old man who had been sufficient unto himself for seventy years and who had never deigned to care what opinion the world held of him so long as it did not interfere with his comfort or entertainment
and the fact was indeed that he had never before condescended to reflect upon it at all and he only did so now because a child had believed him better than he was and by wishing to follow in his illustrious footsteps and imitate his example had suggested to him the curious question whether he was exactly the person to take as a model
fauntleroy thought the earl foot must be hurting him his brows knitted themselves together so as he looked out at the park and thinking this the considerate little fellow tried not to disturb him and enjoyed the trees and the ferns and the deer in silence
but at last the carriage having passed the gates and bowled through the green lanes for a short distance stopped
they had reached court lodge and fauntleroy was out upon the ground almost before the big footman had time to open the carriage door
the earl wakened from his reverie with a start
what
he said
are we here
yes said fauntleroy
let me give you your stick
just lean on me when you get out
i am not going to get out replied his lordship brusquely
not  not to see dearest
exclaimed fauntleroy with astonished face
dearest will excuse me said the earl dryly
go to her and tell her that not even a new pony would keep you away
she will be disappointed said fauntleroy
she will want to see you very much
i am afraid not was the answer
the carriage will call for you as we come back
tell jeffries to drive on thomas
thomas closed the carriage door and after a puzzled look fauntleroy ran up the drive
the earl had the opportunity  as mr havisham once had  of seeing a pair of handsome strong little legs flash over the ground with astonishing rapidity
evidently their owner had no intention of losing any time
the carriage rolled slowly away but his lordship did not at once lean back he still looked out
through a space in the trees he could see the house door it was wide open
the little figure dashed up the steps another figure  a little figure too slender and young in its black gown  ran to meet it
it seemed as if they flew together as fauntleroy leaped into his mother arms hanging about her neck and covering her sweet young face with kisses
vii on the following sunday morning mr mordaunt had a large congregation
indeed he could scarcely remember any sunday on which the church had been so crowded
people appeared upon the scene who seldom did him the honor of coming to hear his sermons
there were even people from hazelton which was the next parish
there were hearty sunburned farmers stout comfortable apple cheeked wives in their best bonnets and most gorgeous shawls and half a dozen children or so to each family
the doctor wife was there with her four daughters
mrs kimsey and mr kimsey who kept the druggist shop and made pills and did up powders for everybody within ten miles sat in their pew mrs dibble in hers miss smiff the village dressmaker and her friend miss perkins the milliner sat in theirs the doctor young man was present and the druggist apprentice in fact almost every family on the county side was represented in one way or another
in the course of the preceding week many wonderful stories had been told of little lord fauntleroy
mrs dibble had been kept so busy attending to customers who came in to buy a pennyworth of needles or a haporth of tape and to hear what she had to relate that the little shop bell over the door had nearly tinkled itself to death over the coming and going
mrs dibble knew exactly how his small lordship rooms had been furnished for him what expensive toys had been bought how there was a beautiful brown pony awaiting him and a small groom to attend it and a little dog cart with silver mounted harness
and she could tell too what all the servants had said when they had caught glimpses of the child on the night of his arrival and how every female below stairs had said it was a shame so it was to part the poor pretty dear from his mother and had all declared their hearts came into their mouths when he went alone into the library to see his grandfather for there was no knowing how hed be treated and his lordship temper was enough to fluster them with old heads on their shoulders let alone a child
but if youll believe me mrs jennifer mum mrs dibble had said fear that child does not know  so mr thomas hisself says an set an smile he did an talked to his lordship as if theyd been friends ever since his first hour
an the earl so took aback mr thomas says that he couldnt do nothing but listen and stare from under his eyebrows
an it mr thomas opinion mrs bates mum that bad as he is he was pleased in his secret soul an proud too for a handsomer little fellow or with better manners though so old fashioned mr thomas says hed never wish to see
and then there had come the story of higgins
the reverend mr mordaunt had told it at his own dinner table and the servants who had heard it had told it in the kitchen and from there it had spread like wildfire
and on market day when higgins had appeared in town he had been questioned on every side and newick had been questioned too and in response had shown to two or three people the note signed fauntleroy
and so the farmers wives had found plenty to talk of over their tea and their shopping and they had done the subject full justice and made the most of it
and on sunday they had either walked to church or had been driven in their gigs by their husbands who were perhaps a trifle curious themselves about the new little lord who was to be in time the owner of the soil
it was by no means the earl habit to attend church but he chose to appear on this first sunday  it was his whim to present himself in the huge family pew with fauntleroy at his side
there were many loiterers in the churchyard and many lingerers in the lane that morning
there were groups at the gates and in the porch and there had been much discussion as to whether my lord would really appear or not
when this discussion was at its height one good woman suddenly uttered an exclamation
eh she said that must be the mother pretty young thing
all who heard turned and looked at the slender figure in black coming up the path
the veil was thrown back from her face and they could see how fair and sweet it was and how the bright hair curled as softly as a child under the little widow cap
she was not thinking of the people about she was thinking of cedric and of his visits to her and his joy over his new pony on which he had actually ridden to her door the day before sitting very straight and looking very proud and happy
but soon she could not help being attracted by the fact that she was being looked at and that her arrival had created some sort of sensation
she first noticed it because an old woman in a red cloak made a bobbing courtesy to her and then another did the same thing and said god bless you my lady
and one man after another took off his hat as she passed
for a moment she did not understand and then she realized that it was because she was little lord fauntleroy mother that they did so and she flushed rather shyly and smiled and bowed too and said thank you in a gentle voice to the old woman who had blessed her
to a person who had always lived in a bustling crowded american city this simple deference was very novel and at first just a little embarrassing but after all she could not help liking and being touched by the friendly warm heartedness of which it seemed to speak
she had scarcely passed through the stone porch into the church before the great event of the day happened
the carriage from the castle with its handsome horses and tall liveried servants bowled around the corner and down the green lane
here they come
went from one looker on to another
and then the carriage drew up and thomas stepped down and opened the door and a little boy dressed in black velvet and with a splendid mop of bright waving hair jumped out
every man woman and child looked curiously upon him
he the captain over again
said those of the on lookers who remembered his father
he the captain self to the life
he stood there in the sunlight looking up at the earl as thomas helped that nobleman out with the most affectionate interest that could be imagined
the instant he could help he put out his hand and offered his shoulder as if he had been seven feet high
it was plain enough to every one that however it might be with other people the earl of dorincourt struck no terror into the breast of his grandson
just lean on me they heard him say
how glad the people are to see you and how well they all seem to know you
take off your cap fauntleroy said the earl
they are bowing to you
to me
cried fauntleroy whipping off his cap in a moment baring his bright head to the crowd and turning shining puzzled eyes on them as he tried to bow to every one at once
god bless your lordship
said the courtesying red cloaked old woman who had spoken to his mother long life to you
thank you maam said fauntleroy
and then they went into the church and were looked at there on their way up the aisle to the square red cushioned and curtained pew
when fauntleroy was fairly seated he made two discoveries which pleased him the first that across the church where he could look at her his mother sat and smiled at him the second that at one end of the pew against the wall knelt two quaint figures carven in stone facing each other as they kneeled on either side of a pillar supporting two stone missals their pointed hands folded as if in prayer their dress very antique and strange
on the tablet by them was written something of which he could only read the curious words here lyeth ye bodye of gregorye arthure fyrst earle of dorincourt allsoe of alisone hildegarde hys wyfe
may i whisper
inquired his lordship devoured by curiosity
what is it
said his grandfather
who are they
some of your ancestors answered the earl who lived a few hundred years ago
perhaps said lord fauntleroy regarding them with respect perhaps i got my spelling from them
and then he proceeded to find his place in the church service
when the music began he stood up and looked across at his mother smiling
he was very fond of music and his mother and he often sang together so he joined in with the rest his pure sweet high voice rising as clear as the song of a bird
he quite forgot himself in his pleasure in it
the earl forgot himself a little too as he sat in his curtain shielded corner of the pew and watched the boy
cedric stood with the big psalter open in his hands singing with all his childish might his face a little uplifted happily and as he sang a long ray of sunshine crept in and slanting through a golden pane of a stained glass window brightened the falling hair about his young head
his mother as she looked at him across the church felt a thrill pass through her heart and a prayer rose in it too  a prayer that the pure simple happiness of his childish soul might last and that the strange great fortune which had fallen to him might bring no wrong or evil with it
there were many soft anxious thoughts in her tender heart in those new days
oh ceddie
she had said to him the evening before as she hung over him in saying good night before he went away oh ceddie dear i wish for your sake i was very clever and could say a great many wise things
but only be good dear only be brave only be kind and true always and then you will never hurt any one so long as you live and you may help many and the big world may be better because my little child was born
and that is best of all ceddie  it is better than everything else that the world should be a little better because a man has lived  even ever so little better dearest
and on his return to the castle fauntleroy had repeated her words to his grandfather
and i thought about you when she said that he ended and i told her that was the way the world was because you had lived and i was going to try if i could be like you
and what did she say to that
asked his lordship a trifle uneasily
she said that was right and we must always look for good in people and try to be like it
perhaps it was this the old man remembered as he glanced through the divided folds of the red curtain of his pew
many times he looked over the people heads to where his son wife sat alone and he saw the fair face the unforgiven dead had loved and the eyes which were so like those of the child at his side but what his thoughts were and whether they were hard and bitter or softened a little it would have been hard to discover
as they came out of church many of those who had attended the service stood waiting to see them pass
as they neared the gate a man who stood with his hat in his hand made a step forward and then hesitated
he was a middle aged farmer with a careworn face
well higgins said the earl
fauntleroy turned quickly to look at him
oh
he exclaimed is it mr higgins
yes answered the earl dryly and i suppose he came to take a look at his new landlord
yes my lord said the man his sunburned face reddening
mr newick told me his young lordship was kind enough to speak for me and i thought id like to say a word of thanks if i might be allowed
perhaps he felt some wonder when he saw what a little fellow it was who had innocently done so much for him and who stood there looking up just as one of his own less fortunate children might have done  apparently not realizing his own importance in the least
ive a great deal to thank your lordship for he said a great deal
i     oh said fauntleroy i only wrote the letter
it was my grandfather who did it
but you know how he is about always being good to everybody
is mrs higgins well now
higgins looked a trifle taken aback
he also was somewhat startled at hearing his noble landlord presented in the character of a benevolent being full of engaging qualities
i  well yes your lordship he stammered the missus is better since the trouble was took off her mind
it was worrying broke her down
im glad of that said fauntleroy
my grandfather was very sorry about your children having the scarlet fever and so was i
he has had children himself
im his son little boy you know
higgins was on the verge of being panic stricken
he felt it would be the safer and more discreet plan not to look at the earl as it had been well known that his fatherly affection for his sons had been such that he had seen them about twice a year and that when they had been ill he had promptly departed for london because he would not be bored with doctors and nurses
it was a little trying therefore to his lordship nerves to be told while he looked on his eyes gleaming from under his shaggy eyebrows that he felt an interest in scarlet fever
you see higgins broke in the earl with a fine grim smile you people have been mistaken in me
lord fauntleroy understands me
when you want reliable information on the subject of my character apply to him
get into the carriage fauntleroy
and fauntleroy jumped in and the carriage rolled away down the green lane and even when it turned the corner into the high road the earl was still grimly smiling
viii lord dorincourt had occasion to wear his grim smile many a time as the days passed by
indeed as his acquaintance with his grandson progressed he wore the smile so often that there were moments when it almost lost its grimness
there is no denying that before lord fauntleroy had appeared on the scene the old man had been growing very tired of his loneliness and his gout and his seventy years
after so long a life of excitement and amusement it was not agreeable to sit alone even in the most splendid room with one foot on a gout stool and with no other diversion than flying into a rage and shouting at a frightened footman who hated the sight of him
the old earl was too clever a man not to know perfectly well that his servants detested him and that even if he had visitors they did not come for love of him  though some found a sort of amusement in his sharp sarcastic talk which spared no one
so long as he had been strong and well he had gone from one place to another pretending to amuse himself though he had not really enjoyed it and when his health began to fail he felt tired of everything and shut himself up at dorincourt with his gout and his newspapers and his books
but he could not read all the time and he became more and more bored as he called it
he hated the long nights and days and he grew more and more savage and irritable
and then fauntleroy came and when the earl saw him fortunately for the little fellow the secret pride of the grandfather was gratified at the outset
if cedric had been a less handsome little fellow the old man might have taken so strong a dislike to him that he would not have given himself the chance to see his grandson finer qualities
but he chose to think that cedric beauty and fearless spirit were the results of the dorincourt blood and a credit to the dorincourt rank
and then when he heard the lad talk and saw what a well bred little fellow he was notwithstanding his boyish ignorance of all that his new position meant the old earl liked his grandson more and actually began to find himself rather entertained
it had amused him to give into those childish hands the power to bestow a benefit on poor higgins
my lord cared nothing for poor higgins but it pleased him a little to think that his grandson would be talked about by the country people and would begin to be popular with the tenantry even in his childhood
then it had gratified him to drive to church with cedric and to see the excitement and interest caused by the arrival
he knew how the people would speak of the beauty of the little lad of his fine strong straight body of his erect bearing his handsome face and his bright hair and how they would say as the earl had heard one woman exclaim to another that the boy was every inch a lord
my lord of dorincourt was an arrogant old man proud of his name proud of his rank and therefore proud to show the world that at last the house of dorincourt had an heir who was worthy of the position he was to fill
the morning the new pony had been tried the earl had been so pleased that he had almost forgotten his gout
when the groom had brought out the pretty creature which arched its brown glossy neck and tossed its fine head in the sun the earl had sat at the open window of the library and had looked on while fauntleroy took his first riding lesson
he wondered if the boy would show signs of timidity
it was not a very small pony and he had often seen children lose courage in making their first essay at riding
fauntleroy mounted in great delight
he had never been on a pony before and he was in the highest spirits
wilkins the groom led the animal by the bridle up and down before the library window
he a well plucked un he is wilkins remarked in the stable afterward with many grins
it werent no trouble to put him up
an a old un wouldnt ha sat any straighter when he were up
he ses  ses he to me wilkins he ses am i sitting up straight
they sit up straight at the circus ses he
an i ses as straight as a arrer your lordship
an he laughs as pleased as could be an he ses that right he ses you tell me if i dont sit up straight wilkins
but sitting up straight and being led at a walk were not altogether and completely satisfactory
after a few minutes fauntleroy spoke to his grandfather  watching him from the window cant i go by myself
he asked and cant i go faster
the boy on fifth avenue used to trot and canter
do you think you could trot and canter
said the earl
i should like to try answered fauntleroy
his lordship made a sign to wilkins who at the signal brought up his own horse and mounted it and took fauntleroy pony by the leading rein
now said the earl let him trot
the next few minutes were rather exciting to the small equestrian
he found that trotting was not so easy as walking and the faster the pony trotted the less easy it was
it j jolts a g goo good deal  do doesnt it
he said to wilkins
d does it j jolt y you
no my lord answered wilkins
youll get used to it in time
rise in your stirrups
im ri rising all the t time said fauntleroy
he was both rising and falling rather uncomfortably and with many shakes and bounces
he was out of breath and his face grew red but he held on with all his might and sat as straight as he could
the earl could see that from his window
when the riders came back within speaking distance after they had been hidden by the trees a few minutes fauntleroy hat was off his cheeks were like poppies and his lips were set but he was still trotting manfully
stop a minute
said his grandfather
where your hat
wilkins touched his
it fell off your lordship he said with evident enjoyment
wouldnt let me stop to pick it up my lord
not much afraid is he
asked the earl dryly
him your lordship
exclaimed wilkins
i shouldnt say as he knowed what it meant
ive taught young genlemen to ride afore an i never see one stick on more determinder
tired
said the earl to fauntleroy
want to get off
it jolts you more than you think it will admitted his young lordship frankly
and it tires you a little too but i dont want to get off
i want to learn how
as soon as ive got my breath i want to go back for the hat
the cleverest person in the world if he had undertaken to teach fauntleroy how to please the old man who watched him could not have taught him anything which would have succeeded better
as the pony trotted off again toward the avenue a faint color crept up in the fierce old face and the eyes under the shaggy brows gleamed with a pleasure such as his lordship had scarcely expected to know again
and he sat and watched quite eagerly until the sound of the horses hoofs returned
when they did come which was after some time they came at a faster pace
fauntleroy hat was still off wilkins was carrying it for him his cheeks were redder than before and his hair was flying about his ears but he came at quite a brisk canter
there
he panted as they drew up i c cantered
i didnt do it as well as the boy on fifth avenue but i did it and i staid on
he and wilkins and the pony were close friends after that
scarcely a day passed in which the country people did not see them out together cantering gayly on the highroad or through the green lanes
the children in the cottages would run to the door to look at the proud little brown pony with the gallant little figure sitting so straight in the saddle and the young lord would snatch off his cap and swing it at them and shout hullo
good morning
in a very unlordly manner though with great heartiness
sometimes he would stop and talk with the children and once wilkins came back to the castle with a story of how fauntleroy had insisted on dismounting near the village school so that a boy who was lame and tired might ride home on his pony
an im blessed said wilkins in telling the story at the stables  im blessed if hed hear of anything else
he wouldnt let me get down because he said the boy mightnt feel comfortable on a big horse
an ses he wilkins ses he that boy lame and im not and i want to talk to him too
and up the lad has to get and my lord trudges alongside of him with his hands in his pockets and his cap on the back of his head a whistling and talking as easy as you please
and when we come to the cottage an the boy mother come out all in a taking to see what up he whips off his cap an ses he ive brought your son home maam ses he because his leg hurt him and i dont think that stick is enough for him to lean on and im going to ask my grandfather to have a pair of crutches made for him
an im blessed if the woman wasnt struck all of a heap as well she might be
i thought i should a hex plodid myself
when the earl heard the story he was not angry as wilkins had been half afraid that he would be on the contrary he laughed outright and called fauntleroy up to him and made him tell all about the matter from beginning to end and then he laughed again
and actually a few days later the dorincourt carriage stopped in the green lane before the cottage where the lame boy lived and fauntleroy jumped out and walked up to the door carrying a pair of strong light new crutches shouldered like a gun and presented them to mrs hartle the lame boy name was hartle with these words my grandfather compliments and if you please these are for your boy and we hope he will get better
i said your compliments he explained to the earl when he returned to the carriage
you didnt tell me to but i thought perhaps you forgot
that was right wasnt it
and the earl laughed again and did not say it was not
in fact the two were becoming more intimate every day and every day fauntleroy faith in his lordship benevolence and virtue increased
he had no doubt whatever that his grandfather was the most amiable and generous of elderly gentlemen
certainly he himself found his wishes gratified almost before they were uttered and such gifts and pleasures were lavished upon him that he was sometimes almost bewildered by his own possessions
apparently he was to have everything he wanted and to do everything he wished to do
and though this would certainly not have been a very wise plan to pursue with all small boys his young lordship bore it amazingly well
perhaps notwithstanding his sweet nature he might have been somewhat spoiled by it if it had not been for the hours he spent with his mother at court lodge
that best friend of his watched over him ever closely and tenderly
the two had many long talks together and he never went back to the castle with her kisses on his cheeks without carrying in his heart some simple pure words worth remembering
there was one thing it is true which puzzled the little fellow very much
he thought over the mystery of it much oftener than any one supposed even his mother did not know how often he pondered on it the earl for a long time never suspected that he did so at all
but being quick to observe the little boy could not help wondering why it was that his mother and grandfather never seemed to meet
he had noticed that they never did meet
when the dorincourt carriage stopped at court lodge the earl never alighted and on the rare occasions of his lordship going to church fauntleroy was always left to speak to his mother in the porch alone or perhaps to go home with her
and yet every day fruit and flowers were sent to court lodge from the hot houses at the castle
but the one virtuous action of the earl which had set him upon the pinnacle of perfection in cedric eyes was what he had done soon after that first sunday when mrs errol had walked home from church unattended
about a week later when cedric was going one day to visit his mother he found at the door instead of the large carriage and prancing pair a pretty little brougham and a handsome bay horse
that is a present from you to your mother the earl said abruptly
she can not go walking about the country
she needs a carriage
the man who drives will take charge of it
it is a present from you
fauntleroy delight could but feebly express itself
he could scarcely contain himself until he reached the lodge
his mother was gathering roses in the garden
he flung himself out of the little brougham and flew to her
dearest
he cried could you believe it
this is yours
he says it is a present from me
it is your own carriage to drive everywhere in
he was so happy that she did not know what to say
she could not have borne to spoil his pleasure by refusing to accept the gift even though it came from the man who chose to consider himself her enemy
she was obliged to step into the carriage roses and all and let herself be taken to drive while fauntleroy told her stories of his grandfather goodness and amiability
they were such innocent stories that sometimes she could not help laughing a little and then she would draw her little boy closer to her side and kiss him feeling glad that he could see only good in the old man who had so few friends
the very next day after that fauntleroy wrote to mr hobbs
he wrote quite a long letter and after the first copy was written he brought it to his grandfather to be inspected
because he said it so uncertain about the spelling
and if youll tell me the mistakes ill write it out again
this was what he had written my dear mr hobbs i want to tell you about my granfarther he is the best earl you ever new it is a mistake about earls being tirents he is not a tirent at all i wish you new him you would be good friends i am sure you would he has the gout in his foot and is a grate sufrer but he is so pashent i love him more every day becaus no one could help loving an earl like that who is kind to every one in this world i wish you could talk to him he knows everything in the world you can ask him any question but he has never plaid base ball he has given me a pony and a cart and my mamma a bewtifle cariage and i have three rooms and toys of all kinds it would serprise you you would like the castle and the park it is such a large castle you could lose yourself wilkins tells me wilkins is my groom he says there is a dungon under the castle it is so pretty everything in the park would serprise you there are such big trees and there are deers and rabbits and games flying about in the cover my granfarther is very rich but he is not proud and orty as you thought earls always were i like to be with him the people are so polite and kind they take of their hats to you and the women make curtsies and sometimes say god bless you i can ride now but at first it shook me when i troted my granfarther let a poor man stay on his farm when he could not pay his rent and mrs mellon went to take wine and things to his sick children i should like to see you and i wish dearest could live at the castle but i am very happy when i dont miss her too much and i love my granfarther every one does plees write soon your afechshnet old frend cedric errol p s no one is in the dungon my granfarfher never had any one langwishin in there
p s he is such a good earl he reminds me of you he is a unerversle favrit do you miss your mother very much
asked the earl when he had finished reading this
yes said fauntleroy i miss her all the time
he went and stood before the earl and put his hand on his knee looking up at him
you dont miss her do you
he said
i dont know her answered his lordship rather crustily
i know that said fauntleroy and that what makes me wonder
she told me not to ask you any questions and  and i wont but sometimes i cant help thinking you know and it makes me all puzzled
but im not going to ask any questions
and when i miss her very much i go and look out of my window to where i see her light shine for me every night through an open place in the trees
it is a long way off but she puts it in her window as soon as it is dark and i can see it twinkle far away and i know what it says
what does it say
asked my lord
it says good night god keep you all the night
just what she used to say when we were together
every night she used to say that to me and every morning she said god bless you all the day
so you see i am quite safe all the time     quite i have no doubt said his lordship dryly
and he drew down his beetling eyebrows and looked at the little boy so fixedly and so long that fauntleroy wondered what he could be thinking of
ix the fact was his lordship the earl of dorincourt thought in those days of many things of which he had never thought before and all his thoughts were in one way or another connected with his grandson
his pride was the strongest part of his nature and the boy gratified it at every point
through this pride he began to find a new interest in life
he began to take pleasure in showing his heir to the world
the world had known of his disappointment in his sons so there was an agreeable touch of triumph in exhibiting this new lord fauntleroy who could disappoint no one
he wished the child to appreciate his own power and to understand the splendor of his position he wished that others should realize it too
he made plans for his future
sometimes in secret he actually found himself wishing that his own past life had been a better one and that there had been less in it that this pure childish heart would shrink from if it knew the truth
it was not agreeable to think how the beautiful innocent face would look if its owner should be made by any chance to understand that his grandfather had been called for many a year the wicked earl of dorincourt
the thought even made him feel a trifle nervous
he did not wish the boy to find it out
sometimes in this new interest he forgot his gout and after a while his doctor was surprised to find his noble patient health growing better than he had expected it ever would be again
perhaps the earl grew better because the time did not pass so slowly for him and he had something to think of beside his pains and infirmities
one fine morning people were amazed to see little lord fauntleroy riding his pony with another companion than wilkins
this new companion rode a tall powerful gray horse and was no other than the earl himself
it was in fact fauntleroy who had suggested this plan
as he had been on the point of mounting his pony he had said rather wistfully to his grandfather i wish you were going with me
when i go away i feel lonely because you are left all by yourself in such a big castle
i wish you could ride too
and the greatest excitement had been aroused in the stables a few minutes later by the arrival of an order that selim was to be saddled for the earl
after that selim was saddled almost every day and the people became accustomed to the sight of the tall gray horse carrying the tall gray old man with his handsome fierce eagle face by the side of the brown pony which bore little lord fauntleroy
and in their rides together through the green lanes and pretty country roads the two riders became more intimate than ever
and gradually the old man heard a great deal about dearest and her life
as fauntleroy trotted by the big horse he chatted gayly
there could not well have been a brighter little comrade his nature was so happy
it was he who talked the most
the earl often was silent listening and watching the joyous glowing face
sometimes he would tell his young companion to set the pony off at a gallop and when the little fellow dashed off sitting so straight and fearless he would watch him with a gleam of pride and pleasure in his eyes and when after such a dash fauntleroy came back waving his cap with a laughing shout he always felt that he and his grandfather were very good friends indeed
one thing that the earl discovered was that his son wife did not lead an idle life
it was not long before he learned that the poor people knew her very well indeed
when there was sickness or sorrow or poverty in any house the little brougham often stood before the door
do you know said fauntleroy once they all say god bless you
when they see her and the children are glad
there are some who go to her house to be taught to sew
she says she feels so rich now that she wants to help the poor ones
it had not displeased the earl to find that the mother of his heir had a beautiful young face and looked as much like a lady as if she had been a duchess and in one way it did not displease him to know that she was popular and beloved by the poor
and yet he was often conscious of a hard jealous pang when he saw how she filled her child heart and how the boy clung to her as his best beloved
the old man would have desired to stand first himself and have no rival
that same morning he drew up his horse on an elevated point of the moor over which they rode and made a gesture with his whip over the broad beautiful landscape spread before them
do you know that all that land belongs to me
he said to fauntleroy
does it
answered fauntleroy
how much it is to belong to one person and how beautiful
do you know that some day it will all belong to you  that and a great deal more
to me
exclaimed fauntleroy in rather an awe stricken voice
when
when i am dead his grandfather answered
then i dont want it said fauntleroy i want you to live always
that kind answered the earl in his dry way nevertheless some day it will all be yours  some day you will be the earl of dorincourt
little lord fauntleroy sat very still in his saddle for a few moments
he looked over the broad moors the green farms the beautiful copses the cottages in the lanes the pretty village and over the trees to where the turrets of the great castle rose gray and stately
then he gave a queer little sigh
what are you thinking of
asked the earl
i am thinking replied fauntleroy what a little boy i am
and of what dearest said to me
what was it
inquired the earl
she said that perhaps it was not so easy to be very rich that if any one had so many things always one might sometimes forget that every one else was not so fortunate and that one who is rich should always be careful and try to remember
i was talking to her about how good you were and she said that was such a good thing because an earl had so much power and if he cared only about his own pleasure and never thought about the people who lived on his lands they might have trouble that he could help  and there were so many people and it would be such a hard thing
and i was just looking at all those houses and thinking how i should have to find out about the people when i was an earl
how did you find out about them
as his lordship knowledge of his tenantry consisted in finding out which of them paid their rent promptly and in turning out those who did not this was rather a hard question
newick finds out for me he said and he pulled his great gray mustache and looked at his small questioner rather uneasily
we will go home now he added and when you are an earl see to it that you are a better earl than i have been
he was very silent as they rode home
he felt it to be almost incredible that he who had never really loved any one in his life should find himself growing so fond of this little fellow  as without doubt he was
at first he had only been pleased and proud of cedric beauty and bravery but there was something more than pride in his feeling now
he laughed a grim dry laugh all to himself sometimes when he thought how he liked to have the boy near him how he liked to hear his voice and how in secret he really wished to be liked and thought well of by his small grandson
im an old fellow in my dotage and i have nothing else to think of he would say to himself and yet he knew it was not that altogether
and if he had allowed himself to admit the truth he would perhaps have found himself obliged to own that the very things which attracted him in spite of himself were the qualities he had never possessed  the frank true kindly nature the affectionate trustfulness which could never think evil
it was only about a week after that ride when after a visit to his mother fauntleroy came into the library with a troubled thoughtful face
he sat down in that high backed chair in which he had sat on the evening of his arrival and for a while he looked at the embers on the hearth
the earl watched him in silence wondering what was coming
it was evident that cedric had something on his mind
at last he looked up
does newick know all about the people
he asked
it is his business to know about them said his lordship
been neglecting it  has he
contradictory as it may seem there was nothing which entertained and edified him more than the little fellow interest in his tenantry
he had never taken any interest in them himself but it pleased him well enough that with all his childish habits of thought and in the midst of all his childish amusements and high spirits there should be such a quaint seriousness working in the curly head
there is a place said fauntleroy looking up at him with wide open horror stricken eye  dearest has seen it it is at the other end of the village
the houses are close together and almost falling down you can scarcely breathe and the people are so poor and everything is dreadful
often they have fever and the children die and it makes them wicked to live like that and be so poor and miserable
it is worse than michael and bridget
the rain comes in at the roof
dearest went to see a poor woman who lived there
she would not let me come near her until she had changed all her things
the tears ran down her cheeks when she told me about it
the tears had come into his own eyes but he smiled through them
i told her you didnt know and i would tell you he said
he jumped down and came and leaned against the earl chair
you can make it all right he said just as you made it all right for higgins
you always make it all right for everybody
i told her you would and that newick must have forgotten to tell you
the earl looked down at the hand on his knee
newick had not forgotten to tell him in fact newick had spoken to him more than once of the desperate condition of the end of the village known as earl court
he knew all about the tumble down miserable cottages and the bad drainage and the damp walls and broken windows and leaking roofs and all about the poverty the fever and the misery
mr mordaunt had painted it all to him in the strongest words he could use and his lordship had used violent language in response and when his gout had been at the worst he said that the sooner the people of earl court died and were buried by the parish the better it would be  and there was an end of the matter
and yet as he looked at the small hand on his knee and from the small hand to the honest earnest frank eyed face he was actually a little ashamed both of earl court and himself
what
he said you want to make a builder of model cottages of me do you
and he positively put his own hand upon the childish one and stroked it
those must be pulled down said fauntleroy with great eagerness
dearest says so
let us  let us go and have them pulled down to morrow
the people will be so glad when they see you
theyll know you have come to help them
and his eyes shone like stars in his glowing face
the earl rose from his chair and put his hand on the child shoulder
let us go out and take our walk on the terrace he said with a short laugh and we can talk it over
and though he laughed two or three times again as they walked to and fro on the broad stone terrace where they walked together almost every fine evening he seemed to be thinking of something which did not displease him and still he kept his hand on his small companion shoulder
x the truth was that mrs errol had found a great many sad things in the course of her work among the poor of the little village that appeared so picturesque when it was seen from the moor sides
everything was not as picturesque when seen near by as it looked from a distance
she had found idleness and poverty and ignorance where there should have been comfort and industry
and she had discovered after a while that erleboro was considered to be the worst village in that part of the country
mr mordaunt had told her a great many of his difficulties and discouragements and she had found out a great deal by herself
the agents who had managed the property had always been chosen to please the earl and had cared nothing for the degradation and wretchedness of the poor tenants
many things therefore had been neglected which should have been attended to and matters had gone from bad to worse
as to earl court it was a disgrace with its dilapidated houses and miserable careless sickly people
when first mrs errol went to the place it made her shudder
such ugliness and slovenliness and want seemed worse in a country place than in a city
it seemed as if there it might be helped
and as she looked at the squalid uncared for children growing up in the midst of vice and brutal indifference she thought of her own little boy spending his days in the great splendid castle guarded and served like a young prince having no wish ungratified and knowing nothing but luxury and ease and beauty
and a bold thought came in her wise little mother heart
gradually she had begun to see as had others that it had been her boy good fortune to please the earl very much and that he would scarcely be likely to be denied anything for which he expressed a desire
the earl would give him anything she said to mr mordaunt
he would indulge his every whim
why should not that indulgence be used for the good of others
it is for me to see that this shall come to pass
she knew she could trust the kind childish heart so she told the little fellow the story of earl court feeling sure that he would speak of it to his grandfather and hoping that some good results would follow
and strange as it appeared to every one good results did follow
the fact was that the strongest power to influence the earl was his grandson perfect confidence in him  the fact that cedric always believed that his grandfather was going to do what was right and generous
he could not quite make up his mind to let him discover that he had no inclination to be generous at all and that he wanted his own way on all occasions whether it was right or wrong
it was such a novelty to be regarded with admiration as a benefactor of the entire human race and the soul of nobility that he did not enjoy the idea of looking into the affectionate brown eyes and saying i am a violent selfish old rascal i never did a generous thing in my life and i dont care about earl court or the poor people  or something which would amount to the same thing
he actually had learned to be fond enough of that small boy with the mop of yellow love locks to feel that he himself would prefer to be guilty of an amiable action now and then
and so  though he laughed at himself  after some reflection he sent for newick and had quite a long interview with him on the subject of the court and it was decided that the wretched hovels should be pulled down and new houses should be built
it is lord fauntleroy who insists on it he said dryly he thinks it will improve the property
you can tell the tenants that it his idea
and he looked down at his small lordship who was lying on the hearth rug playing with dougal
the great dog was the lad constant companion and followed him about everywhere stalking solemnly after him when he walked and trotting majestically behind when he rode or drove
of course both the country people and the town people heard of the proposed improvement
at first many of them would not believe it but when a small army of workmen arrived and commenced pulling down the crazy squalid cottages people began to understand that little lord fauntleroy had done them a good turn again and that through his innocent interference the scandal of earl court had at last been removed
if he had only known how they talked about him and praised him everywhere and prophesied great things for him when he grew up how astonished he would have been
but he never suspected it
he lived his simple happy child life  frolicking about in the park chasing the rabbits to their burrows lying under the trees on the grass or on the rug in the library reading wonderful books and talking to the earl about them and then telling the stories again to his mother writing long letters to dick and mr hobbs who responded in characteristic fashion riding out at his grandfather side or with wilkins as escort
as they rode through the market town he used to see the people turn and look and he noticed that as they lifted their hats their faces often brightened very much but he thought it was all because his grandfather was with him
they are so fond of you he once said looking up at his lordship with a bright smile
do you see how glad they are when they see you
i hope they will some day be as fond of me
it must be nice to have everybody like you
and he felt quite proud to be the grandson of so greatly admired and beloved an individual
when the cottages were being built the lad and his grandfather used to ride over to earl court together to look at them and fauntleroy was full of interest
he would dismount from his pony and go and make acquaintance with the workmen asking them questions about building and bricklaying and telling them things about america
after two or three such conversations he was able to enlighten the earl on the subject of brick making as they rode home
i always like to know about things like those he said because you never know what you are coming to
when he left them the workmen used to talk him over among themselves and laugh at his odd innocent speeches but they liked him and liked to see him stand among them talking away with his hands in his pockets his hat pushed back on his curls and his small face full of eagerness
he a rare un they used to say
an a noice little outspoken chap too
not much o th bad stock in him
and they would go home and tell their wives about him and the women would tell each other and so it came about that almost every one talked of or knew some story of little lord fauntleroy and gradually almost every one knew that the wicked earl had found something he cared for at last  something which had touched and even warmed his hard bitter old heart
but no one knew quite how much it had been warmed and how day by day the old man found himself caring more and more for the child who was the only creature that had ever trusted him
he found himself looking forward to the time when cedric would be a young man strong and beautiful with life all before him but having still that kind heart and the power to make friends everywhere and the earl wondered what the lad would do and how he would use his gifts
often as he watched the little fellow lying upon the hearth conning some big book the light shining on the bright young head his old eyes would gleam and his cheek would flush
the boy can do anything he would say to himself anything
he never spoke to any one else of his feeling for cedric when he spoke of him to others it was always with the same grim smile
but fauntleroy soon knew that his grandfather loved him and always liked him to be near  near to his chair if they were in the library opposite to him at table or by his side when he rode or drove or took his evening walk on the broad terrace
do you remember cedric said once looking up from his book as he lay on the rug do you remember what i said to you that first night about our being good companions
i dont think any people could be better companions than we are do you
we are pretty good companions i should say replied his lordship
come here
fauntleroy scrambled up and went to him
is there anything you want the earl asked anything you have not
the little fellow brown eyes fixed themselves on his grandfather with a rather wistful look
only one thing he answered
what is that
inquired the earl
fauntleroy was silent a second
he had not thought matters over to himself so long for nothing
what is it
my lord repeated
fauntleroy answered
it is dearest he said
the old earl winced a little
but you see her almost every day he said
is not that enough
i used to see her all the time said fauntleroy
she used to kiss me when i went to sleep at night and in the morning she was always there and we could tell each other things without waiting
the old eyes and the young ones looked into each other through a moment of silence
then the earl knitted his brows
do you never forget about your mother
he said
no answered fauntleroy never and she never forgets about me
i shouldnt forget about you you know if i didnt live with you
i should think about you all the more
upon my word said the earl after looking at him a moment longer i believe you would
the jealous pang that came when the boy spoke so of his mother seemed even stronger than it had been before it was stronger because of this old man increasing affection for the boy
but it was not long before he had other pangs so much harder to face that he almost forgot for the time he had ever hated his son wife at all
and in a strange and startling way it happened
one evening just before the earl court cottages were completed there was a grand dinner party at dorincourt
there had not been such a party at the castle for a long time
a few days before it took place sir harry lorridaile and lady lorridaile who was the earl only sister actually came for a visit  a thing which caused the greatest excitement in the village and set mrs dibble shop bell tinkling madly again because it was well known that lady lorridaile had only been to dorincourt once since her marriage thirty five years before
she was a handsome old lady with white curls and dimpled peachy cheeks and she was as good as gold but she had never approved of her brother any more than did the rest of the world and having a strong will of her own and not being at all afraid to speak her mind frankly she had after several lively quarrels with his lordship seen very little of him since her young days
she had heard a great deal of him that was not pleasant through the years in which they had been separated
she had heard about his neglect of his wife and of the poor lady death and of his indifference to his children and of the two weak vicious unprepossessing elder boys who had been no credit to him or to any one else
those two elder sons bevis and maurice she had never seen but once there had come to lorridaile park a tall stalwart beautiful young fellow about eighteen years old who had told her that he was her nephew cedric errol and that he had come to see her because he was passing near the place and wished to look at his aunt constantia of whom he had heard his mother speak
lady lorridaile kind heart had warmed through and through at the sight of the young man and she had made him stay with her a week and petted him and made much of him and admired him immensely
he was so sweet tempered light hearted spirited a lad that when he went away she had hoped to see him often again but she never did because the earl had been in a bad humor when he went back to dorincourt and had forbidden him ever to go to lorridaile park again
but lady lorridaile had always remembered him tenderly and though she feared he had made a rash marriage in america she had been very angry when she heard how he had been cast off by his father and that no one really knew where or how he lived
at last there came a rumor of his death and then bevis had been thrown from his horse and killed and maurice had died in rome of the fever and soon after came the story of the american child who was to be found and brought home as lord fauntleroy
probably to be ruined as the others were she said to her husband unless his mother is good enough and has a will of her own to help her to take care of him
but when she heard that cedric mother had been parted from him she was almost too indignant for words
it is disgraceful harry
she said
fancy a child of that age being taken from his mother and made the companion of a man like my brother
he will either be brutal to the boy or indulge him until he is a little monster
if i thought it would do any good to write it wouldnt constantia said sir harry
i know it wouldnt she answered
i know his lordship the earl of dorincourt too well  but it is outrageous
not only the poor people and farmers heard about little lord fauntleroy others knew him
he was talked about so much and there were so many stories of him  of his beauty his sweet temper his popularity and his growing influence over the earl his grandfather  that rumors of him reached the gentry at their country places and he was heard of in more than one county of england
people talked about him at the dinner tables ladies pitied his young mother and wondered if the boy were as handsome as he was said to be and men who knew the earl and his habits laughed heartily at the stories of the little fellow belief in his lordship amiability
sir thomas asshe of asshawe hall being in erleboro one day met the earl and his grandson riding together and stopped to shake hands with my lord and congratulate him on his change of looks and on his recovery from the gout
and d ye know he said when he spoke of the incident afterward the old man looked as proud as a turkey cock and upon my word i dont wonder for a handsomer finer lad than his grandson i never saw
as straight as a dart and sat his pony like a young trooper
and so by degrees lady lorridaile too heard of the child she heard about higgins and the lame boy and the cottages at earl court and a score of other things  and she began to wish to see the little fellow
and just as she was wondering how it might be brought about to her utter astonishment she received a letter from her brother inviting her to come with her husband to dorincourt
it seems incredible
she exclaimed
i have heard it said that the child has worked miracles and i begin to believe it
they say my brother adores the boy and can scarcely endure to have him out of sight
and he is so proud of him
actually i believe he wants to show him to us
and she accepted the invitation at once
when she reached dorincourt castle with sir harry it was late in the afternoon and she went to her room at once before seeing her brother
having dressed for dinner she entered the drawing room
the earl was there standing near the fire and looking very tall and imposing and at his side stood a little boy in black velvet and a large vandyke collar of rich lace  a little fellow whose round bright face was so handsome and who turned upon her such beautiful candid brown eyes that she almost uttered an exclamation of pleasure and surprise at the sight
as she shook hands with the earl she called him by the name she had not used since her girlhood
what molyneux
she said is this the child
yes constantia answered the earl this is the boy
fauntleroy this is your grand aunt lady lorridaile
how do you do grand aunt
said fauntleroy
lady lorridaile put her hand on his shoulders and after looking down into his upraised face a few seconds kissed him warmly
i am your aunt constantia she said and i loved your poor papa and you are very like him
it makes me glad when i am told i am like him answered fauntleroy because it seems as if every one liked him  just like dearest eszackly  aunt constantia adding the two words after a second pause
lady lorridaile was delighted
she bent and kissed him again and from that moment they were warm friends
well molyneux she said aside to the earl afterward it could not possibly be better than this
i think not answered his lordship dryly
he is a fine little fellow
we are great friends
he believes me to be the most charming and sweet tempered of philanthropists
i will confess to you constantia  as you would find it out if i did not  that i am in some slight danger of becoming rather an old fool about him
what does his mother think of you
asked lady lorridaile with her usual straightforwardness
i have not asked her answered the earl slightly scowling
well said lady lorridaile i will be frank with you at the outset molyneux and tell you i dont approve of your course and that it is my intention to call on mrs errol as soon as possible so if you wish to quarrel with me you had better mention it at once
what i hear of the young creature makes me quite sure that her child owes her everything
we were told even at lorridaile park that your poorer tenants adore her already
they adore him said the earl nodding toward fauntleroy
as to mrs errol youll find her a pretty little woman
im rather in debt to her for giving some of her beauty to the boy and you can go to see her if you like
all i ask is that she will remain at court lodge and that you will not ask me to go and see her and he scowled a little again
but he doesnt hate her as much as he used to that is plain enough to me her ladyship said to sir harry afterward
and he is a changed man in a measure and incredible as it may seem harry it is my opinion that he is being made into a human being through nothing more nor less than his affection for that innocent affectionate little fellow
why the child actually loves him  leans on his chair and against his knee
his own children would as soon have thought of nestling up to a tiger
the very next day she went to call upon mrs errol
when she returned she said to her brother molyneux she is the loveliest little woman i ever saw
she has a voice like a silver bell and you may thank her for making the boy what he is
she has given him more than her beauty and you make a great mistake in not persuading her to come and take charge of you
i shall invite her to lorridaile
shell not leave the boy replied the earl
i must have the boy too said lady lorridaile laughing
but she knew fauntleroy would not be given up to her and each day she saw more clearly how closely those two had grown to each other and how all the proud grim old man ambition and hope and love centered themselves in the child and how the warm innocent nature returned his affection with most perfect trust and good faith
she knew too that the prime reason for the great dinner party was the earl secret desire to show the world his grandson and heir and to let people see that the boy who had been so much spoken of and described was even a finer little specimen of boyhood than rumor had made him
bevis and maurice were such a bitter humiliation to him she said to her husband
every one knew it
he actually hated them
his pride has full sway here
perhaps there was not one person who accepted the invitation without feeling some curiosity about little lord fauntleroy and wondering if he would be on view
and when the time came he was on view
the lad has good manners said the earl
he will be in no one way
children are usually idiots or bores  mine were both  but he can actually answer when he spoken to and be silent when he is not
he is never offensive
but he was not allowed to be silent very long
every one had something to say to him
the fact was they wished to make him talk
the ladies petted him and asked him questions and the men asked him questions too and joked with him as the men on the steamer had done when he crossed the atlantic
fauntleroy did not quite understand why they laughed so sometimes when he answered them but he was so used to seeing people amused when he was quite serious that he did not mind
he thought the whole evening delightful
the magnificent rooms were so brilliant with lights there were so many flowers the gentlemen seemed so gay and the ladies wore such beautiful wonderful dresses and such sparkling ornaments in their hair and on their necks
there was one young lady who he heard them say had just come down from london where she had spent the season and she was so charming that he could not keep his eyes from her
she was a rather tall young lady with a proud little head and very soft dark hair and large eyes the color of purple pansies and the color on her cheeks and lips was like that of a rose
she was dressed in a beautiful white dress and had pearls around her throat
there was one strange thing about this young lady
so many gentlemen stood near her and seemed anxious to please her that fauntleroy thought she must be something like a princess
he was so much interested in her that without knowing it he drew nearer and nearer to her and at last she turned and spoke to him
come here lord fauntleroy she said smiling and tell me why you look at me so
i was thinking how beautiful you are his young lordship replied
then all the gentlemen laughed outright and the young lady laughed a little too and the rose color in her cheeks brightened
ah fauntleroy said one of the gentlemen who had laughed most heartily make the most of your time
when you are older you will not have the courage to say that
but nobody could help saying it said fauntleroy sweetly
could you help it
dont you think she is pretty too
we are not allowed to say what we think said the gentleman while the rest laughed more than ever
but the beautiful young lady  her name was miss vivian herbert  put out her hand and drew cedric to her side looking prettier than before if possible
lord fauntleroy shall say what he thinks she said and i am much obliged to him
i am sure he thinks what he says
and she kissed him on his cheek
i think you are prettier than any one i ever saw said fauntleroy looking at her with innocent admiring eyes except dearest
of course i couldnt think any one quite as pretty as dearest
i think she is the prettiest person in the world
i am sure she is said miss vivian herbert
and she laughed and kissed his cheek again
she kept him by her side a great part of the evening and the group of which they were the center was very gay
he did not know how it happened but before long he was telling them all about america and the republican rally and mr hobbs and dick and in the end he proudly produced from his pocket dick parting gift  the red silk handkerchief
i put it in my pocket to night because it was a party he said
i thought dick would like me to wear it at a party
and queer as the big flaming spotted thing was there was a serious affectionate look in his eyes which prevented his audience from laughing very much
you see i like it he said because dick is my friend
but though he was talked to so much as the earl had said he was in no one way
he could be quiet and listen when others talked and so no one found him tiresome
a slight smile crossed more than one face when several times he went and stood near his grandfather chair or sat on a stool close to him watching him and absorbing every word he uttered with the most charmed interest
once he stood so near the chair arm that his cheek touched the earl shoulder and his lordship detecting the general smile smiled a little himself
he knew what the lookers on were thinking and he felt some secret amusement in their seeing what good friends he was with this youngster who might have been expected to share the popular opinion of him
mr havisham had been expected to arrive in the afternoon but strange to say he was late
such a thing had really never been known to happen before during all the years in which he had been a visitor at dorincourt castle
he was so late that the guests were on the point of rising to go in to dinner when he arrived
when he approached his host the earl regarded him with amazement
he looked as if he had been hurried or agitated his dry keen old face was actually pale
i was detained he said in a low voice to the earl by  an extraordinary event
it was as unlike the methodic old lawyer to be agitated by anything as it was to be late but it was evident that he had been disturbed
at dinner he ate scarcely anything and two or three times when he was spoken to he started as if his thoughts were far away
at dessert when fauntleroy came in he looked at him more than once nervously and uneasily
fauntleroy noted the look and wondered at it
he and mr havisham were on friendly terms and they usually exchanged smiles
the lawyer seemed to have forgotten to smile that evening
the fact was he forgot everything but the strange and painful news he knew he must tell the earl before the night was over  the strange news which he knew would be so terrible a shock and which would change the face of everything
as he looked about at the splendid rooms and the brilliant company  at the people gathered together he knew more that they might see the bright haired little fellow near the earl chair than for any other reason  as he looked at the proud old man and at little lord fauntleroy smiling at his side he really felt quite shaken notwithstanding that he was a hardened old lawyer
what a blow it was that he must deal them
he did not exactly know how the long superb dinner ended
he sat through it as if he were in a dream and several times he saw the earl glance at him in surprise
but it was over at last and the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawing room
they found fauntleroy sitting on the sofa with miss vivian herbert  the great beauty of the last london season they had been looking at some pictures and he was thanking his companion as the door opened
im ever so much obliged to you for being so kind to me
he was saying i never was at a party before and ive enjoyed myself so much
he had enjoyed himself so much that when the gentlemen gathered about miss herbert again and began to talk to her as he listened and tried to understand their laughing speeches his eyelids began to droop
they drooped until they covered his eyes two or three times and then the sound of miss herbert low pretty laugh would bring him back and he would open them again for about two seconds
he was quite sure he was not going to sleep but there was a large yellow satin cushion behind him and his head sank against it and after a while his eyelids drooped for the last time
they did not even quite open when as it seemed a long time after some one kissed him lightly on the cheek
it was miss vivian herbert who was going away and she spoke to him softly
good night little lord fauntleroy she said
sleep well
and in the morning he did not know that he had tried to open his eyes and had murmured sleepily good night  im so  glad  i saw you  you are so  pretty     he only had a very faint recollection of hearing the gentlemen laugh again and of wondering why they did it
no sooner had the last guest left the room than mr havisham turned from his place by the fire and stepped nearer the sofa where he stood looking down at the sleeping occupant
little lord fauntleroy was taking his ease luxuriously
one leg crossed the other and swung over the edge of the sofa one arm was flung easily above his head the warm flush of healthful happy childish sleep was on his quiet face his waving tangle of bright hair strayed over the yellow satin cushion
he made a picture well worth looking at
as mr havisham looked at it he put his hand up and rubbed his shaven chin with a harassed countenance
well havisham said the earl harsh voice behind him
what is it
it is evident something has happened
what was the extraordinary event if i may ask
mr havisham turned from the sofa still rubbing his chin
it was bad news he answered distressing news my lord  the worst of news
i am sorry to be the bearer of it
the earl had been uneasy for some time during the evening as he glanced at mr havisham and when he was uneasy he was always ill tempered
why do you look so at the boy
he exclaimed irritably
you have been looking at him all the evening as if  see here now why should you look at the boy havisham and hang over him like some bird of ill omen
what has your news to do with lord fauntleroy
my lord said mr havisham i will waste no words
my news has everything to do with lord fauntleroy
and if we are to believe it  it is not lord fauntleroy who lies sleeping before us but only the son of captain errol
and the present lord fauntleroy is the son of your son bevis and is at this moment in a lodging house in london
the earl clutched the arms of his chair with both his hands until the veins stood out upon them the veins stood out on his forehead too his fierce old face was almost livid
what do you mean
he cried out
you are mad
whose lie is this
if it is a lie answered mr havisham it is painfully like the truth
a woman came to my chambers this morning
she said your son bevis married her six years ago in london
she showed me her marriage certificate
they quarrelled a year after the marriage and he paid her to keep away from him
she has a son five years old
she is an american of the lower classes  an ignorant person  and until lately she did not fully understand what her son could claim
she consulted a lawyer and found out that the boy was really lord fauntleroy and the heir to the earldom of dorincourt and she of course insists on his claims being acknowledged
there was a movement of the curly head on the yellow satin cushion
a soft long sleepy sigh came from the parted lips and the little boy stirred in his sleep but not at all restlessly or uneasily
not at all as if his slumber were disturbed by the fact that he was being proved a small impostor and that he was not lord fauntleroy at all and never would be the earl of dorincourt
he only turned his rosy face more on its side as if to enable the old man who stared at it so solemnly to see it better
the handsome grim old face was ghastly
a bitter smile fixed itself upon it
i should refuse to believe a word of it he said if it were not such a low scoundrelly piece of business that it becomes quite possible in connection with the name of my son bevis
it is quite like bevis
he was always a disgrace to us
always a weak untruthful vicious young brute with low tastes  my son and heir bevis lord fauntleroy
the woman is an ignorant vulgar person you say
i am obliged to admit that she can scarcely spell her own name answered the lawyer
she is absolutely uneducated and openly mercenary
she cares for nothing but the money
she is very handsome in a coarse way but     the fastidious old lawyer ceased speaking and gave a sort of shudder
the veins on the old earl forehead stood out like purple cords
something else stood out upon it too  cold drops of moisture
he took out his handkerchief and swept them away
his smile grew even more bitter
and i he said i objected to  to the other woman the mother of this child pointing to the sleeping form on the sofa i refused to recognize her
and yet she could spell her own name
i suppose this is retribution
suddenly he sprang up from his chair and began to walk up and down the room
fierce and terrible words poured forth from his lips
his rage and hatred and cruel disappointment shook him as a storm shakes a tree
his violence was something dreadful to see and yet mr havisham noticed that at the very worst of his wrath he never seemed to forget the little sleeping figure on the yellow satin cushion and that he never once spoke loud enough to awaken it
i might have known it he said
they were a disgrace to me from their first hour
i hated them both and they hated me
bevis was the worse of the two
i will not believe this yet though
i will contend against it to the last
but it is like bevis  it is like him
and then he raged again and asked questions about the woman about her proofs and pacing the room turned first white and then purple in his repressed fury
when at last he had learned all there was to be told and knew the worst mr havisham looked at him with a feeling of anxiety
he looked broken and haggard and changed
his rages had always been bad for him but this one had been worse than the rest because there had been something more than rage in it
he came slowly back to the sofa at last and stood near it
if any one had told me i could be fond of a child he said his harsh voice low and unsteady i should not have believed them
i always detested children  my own more than the rest
i am fond of this one he is fond of me with a bitter smile
i am not popular i never was
but he is fond of me
he never was afraid of me  he always trusted me
he would have filled my place better than i have filled it
i know that
he would have been an honor to the name
he bent down and stood a minute or so looking at the happy sleeping face
his shaggy eyebrows were knitted fiercely and yet somehow he did not seem fierce at all
he put up his hand pushed the bright hair back from the forehead and then turned away and rang the bell
when the largest footman appeared he pointed to the sofa
take  he said and then his voice changed a little  take lord fauntleroy to his room
xi when mr hobbs young friend left him to go to dorincourt castle and become lord fauntleroy and the grocery man had time to realize that the atlantic ocean lay between himself and the small companion who had spent so many agreeable hours in his society he really began to feel very lonely indeed
the fact was mr hobbs was not a clever man nor even a bright one he was indeed rather a slow and heavy person and he had never made many acquaintances
he was not mentally energetic enough to know how to amuse himself and in truth he never did anything of an entertaining nature but read the newspapers and add up his accounts
it was not very easy for him to add up his accounts and sometimes it took him a long time to bring them out right and in the old days little lord fauntleroy who had learned how to add up quite nicely with his fingers and a slate and pencil had sometimes even gone to the length of trying to help him and then too he had been so good a listener and had taken such an interest in what the newspaper said and he and mr hobbs had held such long conversations about the revolution and the british and the elections and the republican party that it was no wonder his going left a blank in the grocery store
at first it seemed to mr hobbs that cedric was not really far away and would come back again that some day he would look up from his paper and see the little lad standing in the door way in his white suit and red stockings and with his straw hat on the back of his head and would hear him say in his cheerful little voice hello mr hobbs
this is a hot day  isnt it
but as the days passed on and this did not happen mr hobbs felt very dull and uneasy
he did not even enjoy his newspaper as much as he used to
he would put the paper down on his knee after reading it and sit and stare at the high stool for a long time
there were some marks on the long legs which made him feel quite dejected and melancholy
they were marks made by the heels of the next earl of dorincourt when he kicked and talked at the same time
it seems that even youthful earls kick the legs of things they sit on  noble blood and lofty lineage do not prevent it
after looking at those marks mr hobbs would take out his gold watch and open it and stare at the inscription from his oldest friend lord fauntleroy to mr hobbs
when this you see remember me
and after staring at it awhile he would shut it up with a loud snap and sigh and get up and go and stand in the door way  between the box of potatoes and the barrel of apples  and look up the street
at night when the store was closed he would light his pipe and walk slowly along the pavement until he reached the house where cedric had lived on which there was a sign that read this house to let and he would stop near it and look up and shake his head and puff at his pipe very hard and after a while walk mournfully back again
this went on for two or three weeks before any new idea came to him
being slow and ponderous it always took him a long time to reach a new idea
as a rule he did not like new ideas but preferred old ones
after two or three weeks however during which instead of getting better matters really grew worse a novel plan slowly and deliberately dawned upon him
he would go to see dick
he smoked a great many pipes before he arrived at the conclusion but finally he did arrive at it
he would go to see dick
he knew all about dick
cedric had told him and his idea was that perhaps dick might be some comfort to him in the way of talking things over
so one day when dick was very hard at work blacking a customer boots a short stout man with a heavy face and a bald head stopped on the pavement and stared for two or three minutes at the bootblack sign which read professor dick tipton cant be beat
he stared at it so long that dick began to take a lively interest in him and when he had put the finishing touch to his customer boots he said want a shine sir
the stout man came forward deliberately and put his foot on the rest
yes he said
then when dick fell to work the stout man looked from dick to the sign and from the sign to dick
where did you get that
he asked
from a friend o mine said dick  a little feller
he guv me the whole outfit
he was the best little feller ye ever saw
he in england now
gone to be one o them lords
lord  lord   asked mr hobbs with ponderous slowness lord fauntleroy  goin to be earl of dorincourt
dick almost dropped his brush
why boss
he exclaimed d ye know him yerself
ive known him answered mr hobbs wiping his warm forehead ever since he was born
we was lifetime acquaintances  that what we was
it really made him feel quite agitated to speak of it
he pulled the splendid gold watch out of his pocket and opened it and showed the inside of the case to dick
when this you see remember me he read
that was his parting keepsake to me
i dont want you to forget me  those was his words  id ha remembered him he went on shaking his head if he hadnt given me a thing an i hadnt seen hide nor hair on him again
he was a companion as any man would remember
he was the nicest little feller i ever see said dick
an as to sand  i never seen so much sand to a little feller
i thought a heap o him i did  an we was friends too  we was sort o chums from the fust that little young un an me
i grabbed his ball from under a stage fur him an he never forgot it an hed come down here he would with his mother or his nuss and hed holler hello dick
at me as friendly as if he was six feet high when he warnt knee high to a grasshopper and was dressed in gal cloes
he was a gay little chap and when you was down on your luck it did you good to talk to him
that so said mr hobbs
it was a pity to make a earl out of him
he would have shone in the grocery business  or dry goods either he would have shone
and he shook his head with deeper regret than ever
it proved that they had so much to say to each other that it was not possible to say it all at one time and so it was agreed that the next night dick should make a visit to the store and keep mr hobbs company
the plan pleased dick well enough
he had been a street waif nearly all his life but he had never been a bad boy and he had always had a private yearning for a more respectable kind of existence
since he had been in business for himself he had made enough money to enable him to sleep under a roof instead of out in the streets and he had begun to hope he might reach even a higher plane in time
so to be invited to call on a stout respectable man who owned a corner store and even had a horse and wagon seemed to him quite an event
do you know anything about earls and castles
mr hobbs inquired
id like to know more of the particklars
there a story about some on em in the penny story gazette said dick
it called the crime of a coronet or the revenge of the countess may
it a boss thing too
some of us boys re takin it to read
bring it up when you come said mr hobbs an ill pay for it
bring all you can find that have any earls in em
if there arent earls markisesll do or dooks  though he never made mention of any dooks or markises
we did go over coronets a little but i never happened to see any
i guess they dont keep em round here
tiffany d have em if anybody did said dick but i dont know as id know one if i saw it
mr hobbs did not explain that he would not have known one if he saw it
he merely shook his head ponderously
i spose there is very little call for em he said and that ended the matter
this was the beginning of quite a substantial friendship
when dick went up to the store mr hobbs received him with great hospitality
he gave him a chair tilted against the door near a barrel of apples and after his young visitor was seated he made a jerk at them with the hand in which he held his pipe saying help yerself
then he looked at the story papers and after that they read and discussed the british aristocracy and mr hobbs smoked his pipe very hard and shook his head a great deal
he shook it most when he pointed out the high stool with the marks on its legs
there his very kicks he said impressively his very kicks
i sit and look at em by the hour
this is a world of ups an it a world of downs
why hed set there an eat crackers out of a box an apples out of a barrel an pitch his cores into the street an now he a lord a livin in a castle
them a lord kicks theyll be a earl kicks some day
sometimes i says to myself says i well ill be jiggered
he seemed to derive a great deal of comfort from his reflections and dick visit
before dick went home they had a supper in the small back room they had crackers and cheese and sardines and other canned things out of the store and mr hobbs solemnly opened two bottles of ginger ale and pouring out two glasses proposed a toast
here to him
he said lifting his glass an may he teach em a lesson  earls an markises an dooks an all
after that night the two saw each other often and mr hobbs was much more comfortable and less desolate
they read the penny story gazette and many other interesting things and gained a knowledge of the habits of the nobility and gentry which would have surprised those despised classes if they had realized it
one day mr hobbs made a pilgrimage to a book store down town for the express purpose of adding to their library
he went to the clerk and leaned over the counter to speak to him
i want he said a book about earls
what
exclaimed the clerk
a book repeated the grocery man about earls
im afraid said the clerk looking rather queer that we havent what you want
havent
said mr hobbs anxiously
well say markises then  or dooks
i know of no such book answered the clerk
mr hobbs was much disturbed
he looked down on the floor  then he looked up
none about female earls
he inquired
im afraid not said the clerk with a smile
well exclaimed mr hobbs ill be jiggered
he was just going out of the store when the clerk called him back and asked him if a story in which the nobility were chief characters would do
mr hobbs said it would  if he could not get an entire volume devoted to earls
so the clerk sold him a book called the tower of london written by mr harrison ainsworth and he carried it home
when dick came they began to read it
it was a very wonderful and exciting book and the scene was laid in the reign of the famous english queen who is called by some people bloody mary
and as mr hobbs heard of queen mary deeds and the habit she had of chopping people heads off putting them to the torture and burning them alive he became very much excited
he took his pipe out of his mouth and stared at dick and at last he was obliged to mop the perspiration from his brow with his red pocket handkerchief
why he aint safe
he said
he aint safe
if the women folks can sit up on their thrones an give the word for things like that to be done who to know what happening to him this very minute
he no more safe than nothing
just let a woman like that get mad an no one safe
well said dick though he looked rather anxious himself ye see this ere un isnt the one that bossin things now
i know her name victory an this un here in the book her name mary
so it is said mr hobbs still mopping his forehead so it is
an the newspapers are not sayin anything about any racks thumb screws or stake burnin  but still it doesnt seem as if t was safe for him over there with those queer folks
why they tell me they dont keep the fourth o july
he was privately uneasy for several days and it was not until he received fauntleroy letter and had read it several times both to himself and to dick and had also read the letter dick got about the same time that he became composed again
but they both found great pleasure in their letters
they read and re read them and talked them over and enjoyed every word of them
and they spent days over the answers they sent and read them over almost as often as the letters they had received
it was rather a labor for dick to write his
all his knowledge of reading and writing he had gained during a few months when he had lived with his elder brother and had gone to a night school but being a sharp boy he had made the most of that brief education and had spelled out things in newspapers since then and practiced writing with bits of chalk on pavements or walls or fences
he told mr hobbs all about his life and about his elder brother who had been rather good to him after their mother died when dick was quite a little fellow
their father had died some time before
the brother name was ben and he had taken care of dick as well as he could until the boy was old enough to sell newspapers and run errands
they had lived together and as he grew older ben had managed to get along until he had quite a decent place in a store
and then exclaimed dick with disgust blest if he didnt go an marry a gal
just went and got spoony an hadnt any more sense left
married her an set up housekeepin in two back rooms
an a hefty un she was  a regular tiger cat
shed tear things to pieces when she got mad  and she was mad all the time
had a baby just like her  yell day n night
an if i didnt have to tend it
an when it screamed shed fire things at me
she fired a plate at me one day an hit the baby cut its chin
doctor said hed carry the mark till he died
a nice mother she was
crackey
but didnt we have a time  ben n mehself n the young un
she was mad at ben because he didnt make money faster n at last he went out west with a man to set up a cattle ranch
an hadnt been gone a week fore one night i got home from sellin my papers n the rooms wus locked up n empty n the woman o the house she told me minna d gone  shown a clean pair o heels
some un else said shed gone across the water to be nuss to a lady as had a little baby too
never heard a word of her since  nuther has ben
if id ha bin him i wouldnt ha fretted a bit  n i guess he didnt
but he thought a heap o her at the start
tell you he was spoons on her
she was a daisy lookin gal too when she was dressed up n not mad
shed big black eyes n black hair down to her knees shed make it into a rope as big as your arm and twist it round n round her head n i tell you her eyes d snap
folks used to say she was part itali un  said her mother or father d come from there n it made her queer
i tell ye she was one of em  she was
he often told mr hobbs stories of her and of his brother ben who since his going out west had written once or twice to dick
ben luck had not been good and he had wandered from place to place but at last he had settled on a ranch in california where he was at work at the time when dick became acquainted with mr hobbs
that gal said dick one day she took all the grit out o him
i couldnt help feelin sorry for him sometimes
they were sitting in the store door way together and mr hobbs was filling his pipe
he oughtnt to ve married he said solemnly as he rose to get a match
women  i never could see any use in em myself
as he took the match from its box he stopped and looked down on the counter
why
he said if here isnt a letter
i didnt see it before
the postman must have laid it down when i wasnt noticin or the newspaper slipped over it
he picked it up and looked at it carefully
it from him
he exclaimed
that the very one it from
he forgot his pipe altogether
he went back to his chair quite excited and took his pocket knife and opened the envelope
i wonder what news there is this time he said
and then he unfolded the letter and read as follows dorincourt castle my dear mr hobbs i write this in a great hury becaus i have something curous to tell you i know you will be very mutch suprised my dear frend when i tel you
it is all a mistake and i am not a lord and i shall not have to be an earl there is a lady whitch was marid to my uncle bevis who is dead and she has a little boy and he is lord fauntleroy becaus that is the way it is in england the earls eldest sons little boy is the earl if every body else is dead i mean if his farther and grandfarther are dead my grandfarther is not dead but my uncle bevis is and so his boy is lord fauntleroy and i am not becaus my papa was the youngest son and my name is cedric errol like it was when i was in new york and all the things will belong to the other boy i thought at first i should have to give him my pony and cart but my grandfarther says i need not my grandfarther is very sorry and i think he does not like the lady but preaps he thinks dearest and i are sorry because i shall not be an earl i would like to be an earl now better than i thout i would at first becaus this is a beautifle castle and i like every body so and when you are rich you can do so many things i am not rich now becaus when your papa is only the youngest son he is not very rich i am going to learn to work so that i can take care of dearest i have been asking wilkins about grooming horses preaps i might be a groom or a coachman
the lady brought her little boy to the castle and my grandfarther and mr havisham talked to her i think she was angry she talked loud and my grandfarther was angry too i never saw him angry before i wish it did not make them all mad i thort i would tell you and dick right away becaus you would be intrusted so no more at present with love from your old frend cedric errol not lord fauntleroy
mr hobbs fell back in his chair the letter dropped on his knee his pen knife slipped to the floor and so did the envelope
well
he ejaculated i am jiggered
he was so dumfounded that he actually changed his exclamation
it had always been his habit to say i will be jiggered but this time he said i am jiggered
perhaps he really was jiggered
there is no knowing
well said dick the whole thing bust up hasnt it
bust
said mr hobbs
it my opinion it a put up job o the british ristycrats to rob him of his rights because he an american
theyve had a spite agin us ever since the revolution an theyre takin it out on him
i told you he wasnt safe an see what happened
like as not the whole goverment got together to rob him of his lawful ownin
he was very much agitated
he had not approved of the change in his young friend circumstances at first but lately he had become more reconciled to it and after the receipt of cedric letter he had perhaps even felt some secret pride in his young friend magnificence
he might not have a good opinion of earls but he knew that even in america money was considered rather an agreeable thing and if all the wealth and grandeur were to go with the title it must be rather hard to lose it
theyre trying to rob him
he said that what theyre doing and folks that have money ought to look after him
and he kept dick with him until quite a late hour to talk it over and when that young man left he went with him to the corner of the street and on his way back he stopped opposite the empty house for some time staring at the to let and smoking his pipe in much disturbance of mind
xii a very few days after the dinner party at the castle almost everybody in england who read the newspapers at all knew the romantic story of what had happened at dorincourt
it made a very interesting story when it was told with all the details
there was the little american boy who had been brought to england to be lord fauntleroy and who was said to be so fine and handsome a little fellow and to have already made people fond of him there was the old earl his grandfather who was so proud of his heir there was the pretty young mother who had never been forgiven for marrying captain errol and there was the strange marriage of bevis the dead lord fauntleroy and the strange wife of whom no one knew anything suddenly appearing with her son and saying that he was the real lord fauntleroy and must have his rights
all these things were talked about and written about and caused a tremendous sensation
and then there came the rumor that the earl of dorincourt was not satisfied with the turn affairs had taken and would perhaps contest the claim by law and the matter might end with a wonderful trial
there never had been such excitement before in the county in which erleboro was situated
on market days people stood in groups and talked and wondered what would be done the farmers wives invited one another to tea that they might tell one another all they had heard and all they thought and all they thought other people thought
they related wonderful anecdotes about the earl rage and his determination not to acknowledge the new lord fauntleroy and his hatred of the woman who was the claimant mother
but of course it was mrs dibble who could tell the most and who was more in demand than ever
an a bad lookout it is she said
an if you were to ask me maam i should say as it was a judgment on him for the way he treated that sweet young cretur as he parted from her child  for he got that fond of him an that set on him an that proud of him as he amost drove mad by what happened
an what more this new one no lady as his little lordship ma is
she a bold faced black eyed thing as mr thomas says no gentleman in livery ud bemean hisself to be gave orders by and let her come into the house he says an he goes out of it
an the boy dont no more compare with the other one than nothin you could mention
an mercy knows what goin to come of it all an where it to end an you might have knocked me down with a feather when jane brought the news
in fact there was excitement everywhere at the castle in the library where the earl and mr havisham sat and talked in the servants hall where mr thomas and the butler and the other men and women servants gossiped and exclaimed at all times of the day and in the stables where wilkins went about his work in a quite depressed state of mind and groomed the brown pony more beautifully than ever and said mournfully to the coachman that he never taught a young genleman to ride as took to it more natral or was a better plucked one than he was
he was a one as it were some pleasure to ride behind
but in the midst of all the disturbance there was one person who was quite calm and untroubled
that person was the little lord fauntleroy who was said not to be lord fauntleroy at all
when first the state of affairs had been explained to him he had felt some little anxiousness and perplexity it is true but its foundation was not in baffled ambition
while the earl told him what had happened he had sat on a stool holding on to his knee as he so often did when he was listening to anything interesting and by the time the story was finished he looked quite sober
it makes me feel very queer he said it makes me feel  queer
the earl looked at the boy in silence
it made him feel queer too  queerer than he had ever felt in his whole life
and he felt more queer still when he saw that there was a troubled expression on the small face which was usually so happy
will they take dearest house from her  and her carriage
cedric asked in a rather unsteady anxious little voice
no
said the earl decidedly  in quite a loud voice in fact
they can take nothing from her
ah
said cedric with evident relief
cant they
then he looked up at his grandfather and there was a wistful shade in his eyes and they looked very big and soft
that other boy he said rather tremulously  he will have to  to be your boy now  as i was  wont he
no
answered the earl  and he said it so fiercely and loudly that cedric quite jumped
no
he exclaimed in wonderment
wont he
i thought he stood up from his stool quite suddenly
shall i be your boy even if im not going to be an earl
he said
shall i be your boy just as i was before
and his flushed little face was all alight with eagerness
how the old earl did look at him from head to foot to be sure
how his great shaggy brows did draw themselves together and how queerly his deep eyes shone under them  how very queerly
my boy
he said  and if youll believe it his very voice was queer almost shaky and a little broken and hoarse not at all what you would expect an earl voice to be though he spoke more decidedly and peremptorily even than before  yes youll be my boy as long as i live and by george sometimes i feel as if you were the only boy i had ever had
cedric face turned red to the roots of his hair it turned red with relief and pleasure
he put both his hands deep into his pockets and looked squarely into his noble relative eyes
do you
he said
well then i dont care about the earl part at all
i dont care whether im an earl or not
i thought  you see i thought the one that was going to be the earl would have to be your boy too and  and i couldnt be
that was what made me feel so queer
the earl put his hand on his shoulder and drew him nearer
they shall take nothing from you that i can hold for you he said drawing his breath hard
i wont believe yet that they can take anything from you
you were made for the place and  well you may fill it still
but whatever comes you shall have all that i can give you  all
it scarcely seemed as if he were speaking to a child there was such determination in his face and voice it was more as if he were making a promise to himself  and perhaps he was
he had never before known how deep a hold upon him his fondness for the boy and his pride in him had taken
he had never seen his strength and good qualities and beauty as he seemed to see them now
to his obstinate nature it seemed impossible  more than impossible  to give up what he had so set his heart upon
and he had determined that he would not give it up without a fierce struggle
within a few days after she had seen mr havisham the woman who claimed to be lady fauntleroy presented herself at the castle and brought her child with her
she was sent away
the earl would not see her she was told by the footman at the door his lawyer would attend to her case
it was thomas who gave the message and who expressed his opinion of her freely afterward in the servants hall
he hoped he said as he had wore livery in igh famblies long enough to know a lady when he see one an if that was a lady he was no judge o females
the one at the lodge added thomas loftily merican or no merican she one o the right sort as any gentleman ud reckinize with all a heye
i remarked it myself to henery when fust we called there
the woman drove away the look on her handsome common face half frightened half fierce
mr havisham had noticed during his interviews with her that though she had a passionate temper and a coarse insolent manner she was neither so clever nor so bold as she meant to be she seemed sometimes to be almost overwhelmed by the position in which she had placed herself
it was as if she had not expected to meet with such opposition
she is evidently the lawyer said to mrs errol a person from the lower walks of life
she is uneducated and untrained in everything and quite unused to meeting people like ourselves on any terms of equality
she does not know what to do
her visit to the castle quite cowed her
she was infuriated but she was cowed
the earl would not receive her but i advised him to go with me to the dorincourt arms where she is staying
when she saw him enter the room she turned white though she flew into a rage at once and threatened and demanded in one breath
the fact was that the earl had stalked into the room and stood looking like a venerable aristocratic giant staring at the woman from under his beetling brows and not condescending a word
he simply stared at her taking her in from head to foot as if she were some repulsive curiosity
he let her talk and demand until she was tired without himself uttering a word and then he said you say you are my eldest son wife
if that is true and if the proof you offer is too much for us the law is on your side
in that case your boy is lord fauntleroy
the matter will be sifted to the bottom you may rest assured
if your claims are proved you will be provided for
i want to see nothing of either you or the child so long as i live
the place will unfortunately have enough of you after my death
you are exactly the kind of person i should have expected my son bevis to choose
and then he turned his back upon her and stalked out of the room as he had stalked into it
not many days after that a visitor was announced to mrs errol who was writing in her little morning room
the maid who brought the message looked rather excited her eyes were quite round with amazement in fact and being young and inexperienced she regarded her mistress with nervous sympathy
it the earl hisself maam
she said in tremulous awe
when mrs errol entered the drawing room a very tall majestic looking old man was standing on the tiger skin rug
he had a handsome grim old face with an aquiline profile a long white mustache and an obstinate look
mrs errol i believe
he said
mrs errol she answered
i am the earl of dorincourt he said
he paused a moment almost unconsciously to look into her uplifted eyes
they were so like the big affectionate childish eyes he had seen uplifted to his own so often every day during the last few months that they gave him a quite curious sensation
the boy is very like you he said abruptly
it has been often said so my lord she replied but i have been glad to think him like his father also
as lady lorridaile had told him her voice was very sweet and her manner was very simple and dignified
she did not seem in the least troubled by his sudden coming
yes said the earl he is like  my son  too
he put his hand up to his big white mustache and pulled it fiercely
do you know he said why i have come here
i have seen mr havisham mrs errol began and he has told me of the claims which have been made     i have come to tell you said the earl that they will be investigated and contested if a contest can be made
i have come to tell you that the boy shall be defended with all the power of the law
his rights     the soft voice interrupted him
he must have nothing that is not his by right even if the law can give it to him she said
unfortunately the law can not said the earl
if it could it should
this outrageous woman and her child     perhaps she cares for him as much as i care for cedric my lord said little mrs errol
and if she was your eldest son wife her son is lord fauntleroy and mine is not
she was no more afraid of him than cedric had been and she looked at him just as cedric would have looked and he having been an old tyrant all his life was privately pleased by it
people so seldom dared to differ from him that there was an entertaining novelty in it
i suppose he said scowling slightly that you would much prefer that he should not be the earl of dorincourt
her fair young face flushed
it is a very magnificent thing to be the earl of dorincourt my lord she said
i know that but i care most that he should be what his father was  brave and just and true always
in striking contrast to what his grandfather was eh
said his lordship sardonically
i have not had the pleasure of knowing his grandfather replied mrs errol but i know my little boy believes     she stopped short a moment looking quietly into his face and then she added i know that cedric loves you
would he have loved me said the earl dryly if you had told him why i did not receive you at the castle
no answered mrs errol i think not
that was why i did not wish him to know
well said my lord brusquely there are few women who would not have told him
he suddenly began to walk up and down the room pulling his great mustache more violently than ever
yes he is fond of me he said and i am fond of him
i cant say i ever was fond of anything before
i am fond of him
he pleased me from the first
i am an old man and was tired of my life
he has given me something to live for
i am proud of him
i was satisfied to think of his taking his place some day as the head of the family
he came back and stood before mrs errol
i am miserable he said
miserable
he looked as if he was
even his pride could not keep his voice steady or his hands from shaking
for a moment it almost seemed as if his deep fierce eyes had tears in them
perhaps it is because i am miserable that i have come to you he said quite glaring down at her
i used to hate you i have been jealous of you
this wretched disgraceful business has changed that
after seeing that repulsive woman who calls herself the wife of my son bevis i actually felt it would be a relief to look at you
i have been an obstinate old fool and i suppose i have treated you badly
you are like the boy and the boy is the first object in my life
i am miserable and i came to you merely because you are like the boy and he cares for you and i care for him
treat me as well as you can for the boy sake
he said it all in his harsh voice and almost roughly but somehow he seemed so broken down for the time that mrs errol was touched to the heart
she got up and moved an arm chair a little forward
i wish you would sit down she said in a soft pretty sympathetic way
you have been so much troubled that you are very tired and you need all your strength
it was just as new to him to be spoken to and cared for in that gentle simple way as it was to be contradicted
he was reminded of the boy again and he actually did as she asked him
perhaps his disappointment and wretchedness were good discipline for him if he had not been wretched he might have continued to hate her but just at present he found her a little soothing
almost anything would have seemed pleasant by contrast with lady fauntleroy and this one had so sweet a face and voice and a pretty dignity when she spoke or moved
very soon through the quiet magic of these influences he began to feel less gloomy and then he talked still more
whatever happens he said the boy shall be provided for
he shall be taken care of now and in the future
before he went away he glanced around the room
do you like the house
he demanded
very much she answered
this is a cheerful room he said
may i come here again and talk this matter over
as often as you wish my lord she replied
and then he went out to his carriage and drove away thomas and henry almost stricken dumb upon the box at the turn affairs had taken
xiii of course as soon as the story of lord fauntleroy and the difficulties of the earl of dorincourt were discussed in the english newspapers they were discussed in the american newspapers
the story was too interesting to be passed over lightly and it was talked of a great deal
there were so many versions of it that it would have been an edifying thing to buy all the papers and compare them
mr hobbs read so much about it that he became quite bewildered
one paper described his young friend cedric as an infant in arms  another as a young man at oxford winning all the honors and distinguishing himself by writing greek poems one said he was engaged to a young lady of great beauty who was the daughter of a duke another said he had just been married the only thing in fact which was not said was that he was a little boy between seven and eight with handsome legs and curly hair
one said he was no relation to the earl of dorincourt at all but was a small impostor who had sold newspapers and slept in the streets of new york before his mother imposed upon the family lawyer who came to america to look for the earl heir
then came the descriptions of the new lord fauntleroy and his mother
sometimes she was a gypsy sometimes an actress sometimes a beautiful spaniard but it was always agreed that the earl of dorincourt was her deadly enemy and would not acknowledge her son as his heir if he could help it and as there seemed to be some slight flaw in the papers she had produced it was expected that there would be a long trial which would be far more interesting than anything ever carried into court before
mr hobbs used to read the papers until his head was in a whirl and in the evening he and dick would talk it all over
they found out what an important personage an earl of dorincourt was and what a magnificent income he possessed and how many estates he owned and how stately and beautiful was the castle in which he lived and the more they learned the more excited they became
seems like somethin orter be done said mr hobbs
things like them orter be held on to  earls or no earls
but there really was nothing they could do but each write a letter to cedric containing assurances of their friendship and sympathy
they wrote those letters as soon as they could after receiving the news and after having written them they handed them over to each other to be read
this is what mr hobbs read in dick letter dere frend i got ure letter an mr hobbs got his an we are sory u are down on ure luck an we say hold on as longs u kin an dont let no one git ahed of u
there is a lot of ole theves wil make al they kin of u ef u dont kepe ure i skined
but this is mosly to say that ive not forgot wot u did fur me an if there aint no better way cum over here an go in pardners with me
biznes is fine an ile see no harm cums to u enny big feler that trise to cum it over u wil hafter setle it fust with perfessor dick tipton
so no more at present dick
and this was what dick read in mr hobbs letter dear sir yrs received and wd say things looks bad
i believe its a put up job and them thats done it ought to be looked after sharp
and what i write to say is two things
im going to look this thing up
keep quiet and ill see a lawyer and do all i can and if the worst happens and them earls is too many for us theres a partnership in the grocery business ready for you when yure old enough and a home and a friend in yrs truly silas hobbs
well said mr hobbs he pervided for between us if he aint a earl
so he is said dick
id ha stood by him
blest if i didnt like that little feller fust rate
the very next morning one of dick customers was rather surprised
he was a young lawyer just beginning practice  as poor as a very young lawyer can possibly be but a bright energetic young fellow with sharp wit and a good temper
he had a shabby office near dick stand and every morning dick blacked his boots for him and quite often they were not exactly water tight but he always had a friendly word or a joke for dick
that particular morning when he put his foot on the rest he had an illustrated paper in his hand  an enterprising paper with pictures in it of conspicuous people and things
he had just finished looking it over and when the last boot was polished he handed it over to the boy
here a paper for you dick he said you can look it over when you drop in at delmonico for your breakfast
picture of an english castle in it and an english earl daughter in law
fine young woman too  lots of hair  though she seems to be raising rather a row
you ought to become familiar with the nobility and gentry dick
begin on the right honorable the earl of dorincourt and lady fauntleroy
hello
i say what the matter
the pictures he spoke of were on the front page and dick was staring at one of them with his eyes and mouth open and his sharp face almost pale with excitement
what to pay dick
said the young man
what has paralyzed you
dick really did look as if something tremendous had happened
he pointed to the picture under which was written mother of claimant lady fauntleroy
it was the picture of a handsome woman with large eyes and heavy braids of black hair wound around her head
her
said dick
my i know her better n i know you
the young man began to laugh
where did you meet her dick
he said
at newport
or when you ran over to paris the last time
dick actually forgot to grin
he began to gather his brushes and things together as if he had something to do which would put an end to his business for the present
never mind he said
i know her
an ive struck work for this mornin
and in less than five minutes from that time he was tearing through the streets on his way to mr hobbs and the corner store
mr hobbs could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses when he looked across the counter and saw dick rush in with the paper in his hand
the boy was out of breath with running so much out of breath in fact that he could scarcely speak as he threw the paper down on the counter
hello
exclaimed mr hobbs
hello
what you got there
look at it
panted dick
look at that woman in the picture
that what you look at
she aint no ristocrat she aint
with withering scorn
she no lord wife
you may eat me if it aint minna  minna
id know her anywheres an so d ben
jest ax him
mr hobbs dropped into his seat
i knowed it was a put up job he said
i knowed it and they done it on account o him bein a merican
done it
cried dick with disgust
she done it that who done it
she was allers up to her tricks an ill tell yer wot come to me the minnit i saw her pictur
there was one o them papers we saw had a letter in it that said somethin bout her boy an it said he had a scar on his chin
put them two together  her n that there scar
why that there boy o hers aint no more a lord than i am
it ben boy  the little chap she hit when she let fly that plate at me
professor dick tipton had always been a sharp boy and earning his living in the streets of a big city had made him still sharper
he had learned to keep his eyes open and his wits about him and it must be confessed he enjoyed immensely the excitement and impatience of that moment
if little lord fauntleroy could only have looked into the store that morning he would certainly have been interested even if all the discussion and plans had been intended to decide the fate of some other boy than himself
mr hobbs was almost overwhelmed by his sense of responsibility and dick was all alive and full of energy
he began to write a letter to ben and he cut out the picture and inclosed it to him and mr hobbs wrote a letter to cedric and one to the earl
they were in the midst of this letter writing when a new idea came to dick
say he said the feller that give me the paper he a lawyer
let ax him what wed better do
lawyers knows it all
mr hobbs was immensely impressed by this suggestion and dick business capacity
that so
he replied
this here calls for lawyers
and leaving the store in the care of a substitute he struggled into his coat and marched down town with dick and the two presented themselves with their romantic story in mr harrison office much to that young man astonishment
if he had not been a very young lawyer with a very enterprising mind and a great deal of spare time on his hands he might not have been so readily interested in what they had to say for it all certainly sounded very wild and queer but he chanced to want something to do very much and he chanced to know dick and dick chanced to say his say in a very sharp telling sort of way
and said mr hobbs say what your time worth a hour and look into this thing thorough and ill pay the damage  silas hobbs corner of blank street vegetables and fancy groceries
well said mr harrison it will be a big thing if it turns out all right and it will be almost as big a thing for me as for lord fauntleroy and at any rate no harm can be done by investigating
it appears there has been some dubiousness about the child
the woman contradicted herself in some of her statements about his age and aroused suspicion
the first persons to be written to are dick brother and the earl of dorincourt family lawyer
and actually before the sun went down two letters had been written and sent in two different directions  one speeding out of new york harbor on a mail steamer on its way to england and the other on a train carrying letters and passengers bound for california
and the first was addressed to t
havisham esq
and the second to benjamin tipton
and after the store was closed that evening mr hobbs and dick sat in the back room and talked together until midnight
xiv it is astonishing how short a time it takes for very wonderful things to happen
it had taken only a few minutes apparently to change all the fortunes of the little boy dangling his red legs from the high stool in mr hobbs store and to transform him from a small boy living the simplest life in a quiet street into an english nobleman the heir to an earldom and magnificent wealth
it had taken only a few minutes apparently to change him from an english nobleman into a penniless little impostor with no right to any of the splendors he had been enjoying
and surprising as it may appear it did not take nearly so long a time as one might have expected to alter the face of everything again and to give back to him all that he had been in danger of losing
it took the less time because after all the woman who had called herself lady fauntleroy was not nearly so clever as she was wicked and when she had been closely pressed by mr havisham questions about her marriage and her boy she had made one or two blunders which had caused suspicion to be awakened and then she had lost her presence of mind and her temper and in her excitement and anger had betrayed herself still further
all the mistakes she made were about her child
there seemed no doubt that she had been married to bevis lord fauntleroy and had quarreled with him and had been paid to keep away from him but mr havisham found out that her story of the boy being born in a certain part of london was false and just when they all were in the midst of the commotion caused by this discovery there came the letter from the young lawyer in new york and mr hobbs letters also
what an evening it was when those letters arrived and when mr havisham and the earl sat and talked their plans over in the library
after my first three meetings with her said mr havisham i began to suspect her strongly
it appeared to me that the child was older than she said he was and she made a slip in speaking of the date of his birth and then tried to patch the matter up
the story these letters bring fits in with several of my suspicions
our best plan will be to cable at once for these two tiptons  say nothing about them to her  and suddenly confront her with them when she is not expecting it
she is only a very clumsy plotter after all
my opinion is that she will be frightened out of her wits and will betray herself on the spot
and that was what actually happened
she was told nothing and mr havisham kept her from suspecting anything by continuing to have interviews with her in which he assured her he was investigating her statements and she really began to feel so secure that her spirits rose immensely and she began to be as insolent as might have been expected
but one fine morning as she sat in her sitting room at the inn called the dorincourt arms making some very fine plans for herself mr havisham was announced and when he entered he was followed by no less than three persons  one was a sharp faced boy and one was a big young man and the third was the earl of dorincourt
she sprang to her feet and actually uttered a cry of terror
it broke from her before she had time to check it
she had thought of these new comers as being thousands of miles away when she had ever thought of them at all which she had scarcely done for years
she had never expected to see them again
it must be confessed that dick grinned a little when he saw her
hello minna
he said
the big young man  who was ben  stood still a minute and looked at her
do you know her
mr havisham asked glancing from one to the other
yes said ben
i know her and she knows me
and he turned his back on her and went and stood looking out of the window as if the sight of her was hateful to him as indeed it was
then the woman seeing herself so baffled and exposed lost all control over herself and flew into such a rage as ben and dick had often seen her in before
dick grinned a trifle more as he watched her and heard the names she called them all and the violent threats she made but ben did not turn to look at her
i can swear to her in any court he said to mr havisham and i can bring a dozen others who will
her father is a respectable sort of man though he low down in the world
her mother was just like herself
she dead but he alive and he honest enough to be ashamed of her
hell tell you who she is and whether she married me or not
then he clenched his hand suddenly and turned on her
where the child
he demanded
he going with me
he is done with you and so am i
and just as he finished saying the words the door leading into the bedroom opened a little and the boy probably attracted by the sound of the loud voices looked in
he was not a handsome boy but he had rather a nice face and he was quite like ben his father as any one could see and there was the three cornered scar on his chin
ben walked up to him and took his hand and his own was trembling
yes he said i could swear to him too
tom he said to the little fellow im your father ive come to take you away
where your hat
the boy pointed to where it lay on a chair
it evidently rather pleased him to hear that he was going away
he had been so accustomed to queer experiences that it did not surprise him to be told by a stranger that he was his father
he objected so much to the woman who had come a few months before to the place where he had lived since his babyhood and who had suddenly announced that she was his mother that he was quite ready for a change
ben took up the hat and marched to the door
if you want me again he said to mr havisham you know where to find me
he walked out of the room holding the child hand and not looking at the woman once
she was fairly raving with fury and the earl was calmly gazing at her through his eyeglasses which he had quietly placed upon his aristocratic eagle nose
come come my young woman said mr havisham
this wont do at all
if you dont want to be locked up you really must behave yourself
and there was something so very business like in his tones that probably feeling that the safest thing she could do would be to get out of the way she gave him one savage look and dashed past him into the next room and slammed the door
we shall have no more trouble with her said mr havisham
and he was right for that very night she left the dorincourt arms and took the train to london and was seen no more
when the earl left the room after the interview he went at once to his carriage
to court lodge he said to thomas
to court lodge said thomas to the coachman as he mounted the box an you may depend on it things are taking a uniggspected turn
when the carriage stopped at court lodge cedric was in the drawing room with his mother
the earl came in without being announced
he looked an inch or so taller and a great many years younger
his deep eyes flashed
where he said is lord fauntleroy
mrs errol came forward a flush rising to her cheek
is it lord fauntleroy
she asked
is it indeed
the earl put out his hand and grasped hers
yes he answered it is
then he put his other hand on cedric shoulder
fauntleroy he said in his unceremonious authoritative way ask your mother when she will come to us at the castle
fauntleroy flung his arms around his mother neck
to live with us
he cried
to live with us always
the earl looked at mrs errol and mrs errol looked at the earl
his lordship was entirely in earnest
he had made up his mind to waste no time in arranging this matter
he had begun to think it would suit him to make friends with his heir mother
are you quite sure you want me
said mrs errol with her soft pretty smile
quite sure he said bluntly
we have always wanted you but we were not exactly aware of it
we hope you will come
xv ben took his boy and went back to his cattle ranch in california and he returned under very comfortable circumstances
just before his going mr havisham had an interview with him in which the lawyer told him that the earl of dorincourt wished to do something for the boy who might have turned out to be lord fauntleroy and so he had decided that it would be a good plan to invest in a cattle ranch of his own and put ben in charge of it on terms which would make it pay him very well and which would lay a foundation for his son future
and so when ben went away he went as the prospective master of a ranch which would be almost as good as his own and might easily become his own in time as indeed it did in the course of a few years and tom the boy grew up on it into a fine young man and was devotedly fond of his father and they were so successful and happy that ben used to say that tom made up to him for all the troubles he had ever had
but dick and mr hobbs  who had actually come over with the others to see that things were properly looked after  did not return for some time
it had been decided at the outset that the earl would provide for dick and would see that he received a solid education and mr hobbs had decided that as he himself had left a reliable substitute in charge of his store he could afford to wait to see the festivities which were to celebrate lord fauntleroy eighth birthday
all the tenantry were invited and there were to be feasting and dancing and games in the park and bonfires and fire works in the evening
just like the fourth of july
said lord fauntleroy
it seems a pity my birthday wasnt on the fourth doesnt it
for then we could keep them both together
it must be confessed that at first the earl and mr hobbs were not as intimate as it might have been hoped they would become in the interests of the british aristocracy
the fact was that the earl had known very few grocery men and mr hobbs had not had many very close acquaintances who were earls and so in their rare interviews conversation did not flourish
it must also be owned that mr hobbs had been rather overwhelmed by the splendors fauntleroy felt it his duty to show him
the entrance gate and the stone lions and the avenue impressed mr hobbs somewhat at the beginning and when he saw the castle and the flower gardens and the hot houses and the terraces and the peacocks and the dungeon and the armor and the great staircase and the stables and the liveried servants he really was quite bewildered
but it was the picture gallery which seemed to be the finishing stroke
somethin in the manner of a museum
he said to fauntleroy when he was led into the great beautiful room
n  no
said fauntleroy rather doubtfully
i dont think it a museum
my grandfather says these are my ancestors
your aunt sisters
ejaculated mr hobbs
all of em
your great uncle he must have had a family
did he raise em all
and he sank into a seat and looked around him with quite an agitated countenance until with the greatest difficulty lord fauntleroy managed to explain that the walls were not lined entirely with the portraits of the progeny of his great uncle
he found it necessary in fact to call in the assistance of mrs mellon who knew all about the pictures and could tell who painted them and when and who added romantic stories of the lords and ladies who were the originals
when mr hobbs once understood and had heard some of these stories he was very much fascinated and liked the picture gallery almost better than anything else and he would often walk over from the village where he staid at the dorincourt arms and would spend half an hour or so wandering about the gallery staring at the painted ladies and gentlemen who also stared at him and shaking his head nearly all the time
and they was all earls
he would say er pretty nigh it
an he goin to be one of em an own it all
privately he was not nearly so much disgusted with earls and their mode of life as he had expected to be and it is to be doubted whether his strictly republican principles were not shaken a little by a closer acquaintance with castles and ancestors and all the rest of it
at any rate one day he uttered a very remarkable and unexpected sentiment i wouldnt have minded bein one of em myself
he said  which was really a great concession
what a grand day it was when little lord fauntleroy birthday arrived and how his young lordship enjoyed it
how beautiful the park looked filled with the thronging people dressed in their gayest and best and with the flags flying from the tents and the top of the castle
nobody had staid away who could possibly come because everybody was really glad that little lord fauntleroy was to be little lord fauntleroy still and some day was to be the master of everything
every one wanted to have a look at him and at his pretty kind mother who had made so many friends
and positively every one liked the earl rather better and felt more amiably toward him because the little boy loved and trusted him so and because also he had now made friends with and behaved respectfully to his heir mother
it was said that he was even beginning to be fond of her too and that between his young lordship and his young lordship mother the earl might be changed in time into quite a well behaved old nobleman and everybody might be happier and better off
what scores and scores of people there were under the trees and in the tents and on the lawns
farmers and farmers wives in their sunday suits and bonnets and shawls girls and their sweethearts children frolicking and chasing about and old dames in red cloaks gossiping together
at the castle there were ladies and gentlemen who had come to see the fun and to congratulate the earl and to meet mrs errol
lady lorredaile and sir harry were there and sir thomas asshe and his daughters and mr havisham of course and then beautiful miss vivian herbert with the loveliest white gown and lace parasol and a circle of gentlemen to take care of her  though she evidently liked fauntleroy better than all of them put together
and when he saw her and ran to her and put his arm around her neck she put her arms around him too and kissed him as warmly as if he had been her own favorite little brother and she said dear little lord fauntleroy
dear little boy
i am so glad
i am so glad
and afterward she walked about the grounds with him and let him show her everything
and when he took her to where mr hobbs and dick were and said to her this is my old old friend mr hobbs miss herbert and this is my other old friend dick
i told them how pretty you were and i told them they should see you if you came to my birthday  she shook hands with them both and stood and talked to them in her prettiest way asking them about america and their voyage and their life since they had been in england while fauntleroy stood by looking up at her with adoring eyes and his cheeks quite flushed with delight because he saw that mr hobbs and dick liked her so much
well said dick solemnly afterward she the daisiest gal i ever saw
she  well she just a daisy that what she is n no mistake
everybody looked after her as she passed and every one looked after little lord fauntleroy
and the sun shone and the flags fluttered and the games were played and the dances danced and as the gayeties went on and the joyous afternoon passed his little lordship was simply radiantly happy
the whole world seemed beautiful to him
there was some one else who was happy too  an old man who though he had been rich and noble all his life had not often been very honestly happy
perhaps indeed i shall tell you that i think it was because he was rather better than he had been that he was rather happier
he had not indeed suddenly become as good as fauntleroy thought him but at least he had begun to love something and he had several times found a sort of pleasure in doing the kind things which the innocent kind little heart of a child had suggested  and that was a beginning
and every day he had been more pleased with his son wife
it was true as the people said that he was beginning to like her too
he liked to hear her sweet voice and to see her sweet face and as he sat in his arm chair he used to watch her and listen as she talked to her boy and he heard loving gentle words which were new to him and he began to see why the little fellow who had lived in a new york side street and known grocery men and made friends with boot blacks was still so well bred and manly a little fellow that he made no one ashamed of him even when fortune changed him into the heir to an english earldom living in an english castle
it was really a very simple thing after all  it was only that he had lived near a kind and gentle heart and had been taught to think kind thoughts always and to care for others
it is a very little thing perhaps but it is the best thing of all
he knew nothing of earls and castles he was quite ignorant of all grand and splendid things but he was always lovable because he was simple and loving
to be so is like being born a king
as the old earl of dorincourt looked at him that day moving about the park among the people talking to those he knew and making his ready little bow when any one greeted him entertaining his friends dick and mr hobbs or standing near his mother or miss herbert listening to their conversation the old nobleman was very well satisfied with him
and he had never been better satisfied than he was when they went down to the biggest tent where the more important tenants of the dorincourt estate were sitting down to the grand collation of the day
they were drinking toasts and after they had drunk the health of the earl with much more enthusiasm than his name had ever been greeted with before they proposed the health of little lord fauntleroy
and if there had ever been any doubt at all as to whether his lordship was popular or not it would have been settled that instant
such a clamor of voices and such a rattle of glasses and applause
they had begun to like him so much those warm hearted people that they forgot to feel any restraint before the ladies and gentlemen from the castle who had come to see them
they made quite a decent uproar and one or two motherly women looked tenderly at the little fellow where he stood with his mother on one side and the earl on the other and grew quite moist about the eyes and said to one another god bless him the pretty little dear
little lord fauntleroy was delighted
he stood and smiled and made bows and flushed rosy red with pleasure up to the roots of his bright hair
is it because they like me dearest
he said to his mother
is it dearest
im so glad
and then the earl put his hand on the child shoulder and said to him fauntleroy say to them that you thank them for their kindness
fauntleroy gave a glance up at him and then at his mother
must i
he asked just a trifle shyly and she smiled and so did miss herbert and they both nodded
and so he made a little step forward and everybody looked at him  such a beautiful innocent little fellow he was too with his brave trustful face
and he spoke as loudly as he could his childish voice ringing out quite clear and strong
im ever so much obliged to you
he said and  i hope youll enjoy my birthday  because ive enjoyed it so much  and  im very glad im going to be an earl i didnt think at first i should like it but now i do  and i love this place so and i think it is beautiful  and  and  and when i am an earl i am going to try to be as good as my grandfather
and amid the shouts and clamor of applause he stepped back with a little sigh of relief and put his hand into the earl and stood close to him smiling and leaning against his side
and that would be the very end of my story but i must add one curious piece of information which is that mr hobbs became so fascinated with high life and was so reluctant to leave his young friend that he actually sold his corner store in new york and settled in the english village of erlesboro where he opened a shop which was patronized by the castle and consequently was a great success
and though he and the earl never became very intimate if you will believe me that man hobbs became in time more aristocratic than his lordship himself and he read the court news every morning and followed all the doings of the house of lords
and about ten years after when dick who had finished his education and was going to visit his brother in california asked the good grocer if he did not wish to return to america he shook his head seriously
not to live there he said
not to live there i want to be near him an sort o look after him
it a good enough country for them that young an stirrin  but there faults in it
there not an auntsister among em  nor an earl
